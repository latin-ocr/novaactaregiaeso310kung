These equations demonstrate evidently the truth of the theorem.

It is of praetieal use to observe, that 1111)]11111111111 Ψ, (1) is imme>-
clim‘ely obtained by( onzitting) in Ψ<,1’> all tlte ternis, which involve the m -1- l

ΙΙ. If, when 111 < 11, the theoren] just proved is also applioable
to the funetions d‘(,z²) and Ψι (1), either the greatest common measure
of the given funetions will be found by simply applying the theo-
rem, or one will obtain a new func-tion, sueh that the greatest eom-
111011 measure of it and of that of the funetions Φ(,ν) and Ψκω), which
is of the lower degree, will be the same as the greatest. common mea-
sure of the given functions. Going on in this way applying the
theorem as often as possible, either the greatest common measure of
the given functions will be found 01· one must finally obtain two fune-
tions not satisfying the eontlitions of the above theorem, the greatest
0011111101] measure of whieh will also be that of the given func-tiens.

lt remains, therefore, only to shew, how to find the greatest common
measure of two furiet-iens, neither of them involving a power of2z· as faetor
and both ot* which are such, that. their eoel'fieients do not satisfy the whole
system of osmclititms (2) for the 11111111011111111)ν of the theoren] in I. Morem-er,
allowing one of these func-tiens, hut 11111 both, to eontain a power Osa> as
faetor, we may suppose them to he of the same degree, because, as by
suppositien their greatest common measure does not involve any power
of a? as faetor, it will remain unaltered, if we multiply the funetion of
the lower degree bv a suitahle power of ar.

ΙΙΙ. Suppose we have the functions:

of which both (10 not involve powers of «ι’ as faetors and which at the same
time are sueh, that not all the eoeffieients in that, where the index of the last
eoeffieient that really oeeurs is the least, are proportional to the correspon—
