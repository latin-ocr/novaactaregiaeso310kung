deney to flow out to the North and South is thus counterbalanced,
and at the same time it is c‹;›ntinually driven towards the west, until
that motion is limited by enc‹i›untering a continent. The effect of the
solar heat upon the sea—water must therefore here be collected as if to
a kind of focus, for the 19191 11111 11919 be elevated by 1119 dilatation,
that the water has undergone in its passage over the whole region just
mentioned, and by the trade-winds, heaping up the warmed water on
1119 coast. This water 9110 11919 flow off with so much the more force,
as the effect of the said winds in the vieinity of continents is debilita-
ted and becomes irregular. Instead of the relatively thin, weak and
easily chilled sui-face-stream, which the heat could have produced, if the
stream had been spread 0191· 1119 ocean⁷s whole breadth, now appear the
ocean—currents, known under the names of the &alf-stream and the Kuro
Sive, which as well by their power as their 011191 properties have beyond
others attracted universal attention; freely floating streams of warm dark-
blue water, moving with considerable velocity in a bed of more diluted,
cold, and discoloured water from higher latitudes, which they draw to
themselves power-fully by mechanical reaction, and with which they pre-
sent the most marked 9011111191. Their contracted form and great velo-
city render them peculiarly fit to 901119)γ to higher latitudes the 901111
1111110111, which the sea has aequired between the tropieS. The amount
of heat which they themselves in consequence of lneehanical resistanee
develope, even though small relatively to the mass of water, must ne-
19111191999 111 such respects be greater than that of most other ocean-
currents. During their progr-ess 111 11 North—Easterly direction, they in-
crease vastly in mass, but become less rapid and less distinetly defined,
in full accordance with 1119 general laws of 11 surface-current’s motion,
which I 111119 endeavoured to 1191910119 111 tho preceeding pages.

From the causes assigned as the origin of the Gulf-streams, if we
may use that name. in as general 991199, 0119 would evidently be led to
suppose that the Gulf-stream of the Paeific ought be far more powerful
than that of the Atlantic. I need not touch upon the known circum-
stances relating to the 9001001* of the continent's eastern coast-line,
which so essentially contribute to increase the intensity of the Atlantic
Gulf-stream and to reduce the lateral efflux of the equatorial stream,
before the current has yet reached the regions, where the Gulf-stream
properly so called developes itselt'. Neithcr can the great quantity of
river—water, which 19 poured out into the Gulf of Mexico, or 19 carried
thither by the equatorial stream, fail to exercise 1101011091199 011 the
