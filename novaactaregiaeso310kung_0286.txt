the parts of the evaporating region more distant from the equator.

I do not know that attention has been paid to the importance of
evaporation for the formation of the cold under-current in the ocean 1),
whereas evaporation has long been recognized as the cause of the cur-
101110, that exist between the ocean and separate basius such as the Me-
diterranean⁷ in which the annual evaporation exceeds the rainfall. Even
if evaporation in such a basin were not more rapid than in the neigh-
bouring portions of the ocean7 the level of 1110 basin must nevertheless
sink relatively to the 00011110, because the coutraction of the basin's
mouth 111 11 certain degree obstrue-ts the under-circulation⁷ which in the
ocean carries water from localities of overabundant 111-1111011 10 those of
overabundant evaporation. As regards the nature of the stream⁷ produ-
ced by evapcffation, when passing a relatively narrow 01111111, 011011 as
the Straits of Gibraltar7 it must necessarily be very different from the
stream7 which evaporation causes in the open ocean3 for the proportion
between the cvap1:›rating sui-face and the area of 1110 00011011 of the
stream is in this case altogether different. Should the section of the
canal in proportion 10 the quantity of water, that must pass through it
