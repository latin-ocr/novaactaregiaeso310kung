111 comparison with the (16616366, produced by the diminution of the
waterpillar's height. Now 36 evaporation takes place with very different
rapidity in different 1063111166 and 31131116 116 maximum 111 1116 regions7
where the rainfall is least⁷ viz: the region of the trude-winds, this cir-
cumstance must necessarily have 3 csmsideruble iustumne on 111606631116
6116111311011.

By evaporation the equilibrium of 1116 water—1›articles is disturbed
down to the bottoln7 and accordingly the 111011011, which takes place in
order to fill up the vacuum, may extend to 1116 whole 111366, sslthcmgh
the velocity will he different 31 different depths. If we suppose 3 cup-
shaped hollow to be formed by evaporation 111 1116 sui-fuce of 3 111366 of
water, the difference of pressure 111 1116 level, 11131 passos through the
centre of the hollow7 will be greater 111311 111 any level above 11, 311(11116
motion of the water-lmrticles in 11131 plane will 1116161016, be more rapid
than in any plane above it. But in 311 lower lovels the difference of
pressure is the 631116 36 111 11131 level, and it would consequently be 1111-
163601131116 to suppose that the hollow would be filled only by superfit-iul
61-1631116 of its own depth. Motion must 3160 31166 111 1116 lower 611313,
and this motion under the 6611116 of the hollow must be vertically upward.
It will accordingly depend upon the relative dimensions of the water-
111366 and the lmllow, and 011 1116 inclinationis of the latter's surface7
whether the filling of the hollow be owing more to the afflux of the
water from the sides or the rise of that beneuth.

The depressior] of the ocean's surface through evaporation is ex-
tremely small in coinparison to the extent of the sunken sui-face7 and
the volume of the hollow is extremely small in comparison with that of
the ocean. The motion therefore of the approuching particles under 1116
61111366 of the hollow will be chiefly upward, but will gradually approach
to horizonta]7 36 1116 distance from the locality of 1116 hollow 1116163666.
Thus the great evaporation within the tori-id zone ought to produce two
