ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GENERAL UAUSEs OF THE OCEAN-OURRENTS. 27

present, as compared with ordinary river mouths, will then be the follo-
wing. The under-current, which enters an ordinary river-mouth, meets a
gradually diminishing depth; that, which enters the mouth of a ehannel,
such as we are considering, 00011 arrives at a gradually inereasing one.
The stream therefore sinks to the bettoni of the basin, fills its hollows,
overflows its bars, whereby the water, that had previously lain at the
bottom, is raised nearer to the surface. This water, thus raised 10 a
level of greater extent, which was previously covered with still lighter
Water, diffuses itself there, and moreover is sucked 10 1110 00111010 and
innermost branches of the basin by the reaction-streams, which the rivers
produce at their embouohures. At these last spots the deep water rises
most rapidly towards the surface, after having passed through many
degrees of dilutation, and returns, mixed with river-water, to 1110 ocean.
The cause, which gives rise to all these 1110110110 10, 111 my opinion, to
be looked for in the vis viva 10 00 found partly in the superficial stream
at the mouth of the basin, and partly in the much slower flow 011 the
large surface of the basin, and lastly in the more rapid upper-streams
in the vicinity of the river-mmlths.

There is perhaps 110 braneh of the ocean, where these streams
have been developed in so copious and various a manner, as in the sy-
stem of waters, that surrounds the coasts of Sweden. I proceed there-
fore, for the further illustration of the subiect, to communicate the prin-
cipal features of the water-circulation within that system, as far as it is,
chiefly through my own researches, known to 1110. Τ1110 system is, as
is generally known, composed ot' a series of larger and smaller ocean-
basins, separated from eac-h other by prcnnontories and island groups,
Which penetrates into the land in many sinuosities from the southermost
point of Norway till Tornefi, a distance 111 all of 1200 Engl. sea-miles.
These different basins, each ef which has its own hydrographical charac-
ter, are the &camerac-k* and Kattegscct, the mutual limit of which is the
Skaw point, the western brcwclces os' tlte Balsio between Bornholm, Rugen
and the Danish isles, the Baltic itself between Bornholm and the Ᾰ1111111
group of isles, the Botlmian sea between the Ᾰ1111111 10100 and the 0011-
traction of the gulf called Qvarken, and lastly the gyzclf of Botlmc'a, the
most northerly. The smallest channel of connnunication between these
is that, Which unites the Kattegat and the western branches of the Bal-
tic. There, 111 1110 many straits between the Danish islands, the abun-
dance of river—water, which the three last divisions receive, as also the
under-current towards the Baltic must penetrate, and that under-current
