BLESI, so we have here the womansname BLESA. She raised the
stonewmnbels, the lines of standing stones or whatever else they were.
But FRITHELF, probably the widow of his already dead 8011, set up in
his memory the tall ward or beacon. This last additional 1111111( of re-
spect, built up 119111 the grave, is (1181111911)ν mentioned in several of these
runic mortuar)⁷ formulas under the names KASI (Swedish KASE, ΚΑΒ,
vardKAsE‚ 910), ΓΑΒΠ (Sw. VARI» 111111 UTI (Sw. VETTE, VETT)‚
There is therefore nothing surprising in its occurrence here. And 118 we
have elsewhere the KAN- or KEN- or KIN- or KUN-(KEX ων KENNLVG

have the KAN-AN-VART, tlze ΚΒΝ ΟΝ- Imm), tlw H'ARD or VAHDE

ον haaron-pile ΟΝ or AN or TO α per-«tn. We have several of these old

compounds still left. So for instance the modern lox-BUI was once ON-

There 1119 still several places called ΟΜ, ΟΜΝᾸΞ, OMS-JO, etc. in the
north of Sweden. Perhaps 1111 OM may still be found in Gestrikland.

At the 91111, as we see7 there was no room to spare at the tip of
the worm-tail. Hence the contractioris STI for SATI and ΒΓΑ-Η for
RUNA-RAb or RUNA-RIT or RUNA-RITAR, etc.7 1111 which frequently
occur, sometimes 118 here, and for the 8111119 reason, slzortened.

As to the 11111119 of the runc—carver. [t was certainly BAEUMARN,
however we may divide or explain it. Most likely it was quite simply
BAEUM-ARN, BEJIEARX 111 EAGLE, THEE-EAGLE. Compare the. M.
Goth. BAGMS, N. Icel. BADMR, (j).-Engl. BEAM, O.-Sax. BOM, Ohg.
ΒΑῘΪΜ, BOUM, modern Swedish BOM, etc, 11 word once in full use in
Scandinavian as in other Scando-Gothic dialects, but- which gradually
became obsolete in some of them or obtained special meanings7—which
so often happens in 1111 tungs. We have divers runic names ending in
-ARN. This one I have never seen before.
