If an ocean-stream move forward in a mass of water, either at
rest or having a slower motion in the same or any other direction, the
mass of the former will during its progress continually increase, while
that of the latter diminishes3 for tlte more rapis] stream will communicate
its motion to the water-molemus of the latter. Hence arises the sharp de-
finition of the streams, apparent even in the free ocean, which has 80
often been an object of wonder to travellers. The mixture of the waters
of the different streams, which is formed at the place of contact, is in
fact carried off 111 the more rapid stream, in which is it absorbed. In
most cases the more rapid stream is a surface—current of lighter water.
The water of it, that mixes with the surrounding heavier water, does not
therefore continue to run as an intermediate stratum between the streams,
but it sinks into the lighter stream, though not beneath it, as being
lighter than the slower stream's water. The sinking mixture is replaced
by other water, flowing from the middle towards the sides of the stream,
and thus arises within the oonstantly advancing stream an inner circula-
tion in the place of its section. By this 1111181·011811111110111111 on the
whole perpetual, though ever less and less marked difference is main-
tained between this stream and the more slowly flowing heavier water,
the properties of which 1811111111 almost unchanged3 for, though it parts
with some of its water, it receives none. This cimulation, which is also
reinforced by the difference of pressure between the two streamS, 18
also probably the cause of the tendency, which free ocean-currents (e.
g. the Gulfstreem) display, to split longitudinally into new streams.

In some placeS, as e. g. along the Swedish coast of the Ska-
gerack, it happens, that 01 two streams, running beside eachother, that
with the heavier water is the more rapid. ln these cases the circula-
tion just described takes another course, in that the mixture of lighter
water, which the heavier current continually acquires, flows upward. It
then happens, that for a moderate wind the undulations will be more
feeble on those parts of the heavier stream, which are contigu‹;›us to the
lighter water3 for new masses of water, hitherto unaffected by the wind,
are there constantly rising to the surface.

Surface-currents of lighter water have a tendency to diffuse them-
selves, partly in consequence of the new water that they acquire, as
also in consequence 01 the greater lateral pressure due to their higher
level; this will be the greater the lighter the water is in compar-ison
with that around. An ocean-current 01 warm but salt water, such as the
