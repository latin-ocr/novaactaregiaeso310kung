01 1110 ocean, and every motion in one part must give rise to motion in
other parts⁷ every ocean-current strictly speaking depends 011 many such
causes. The business 01 1110 hydrographer should therefore be rather to
discover what part each of them has in the formation of the separate
streams⁷ than to carry out any particular theory grounded upon any
special cause. A quantitative determination 01 this kind can however at
present only be placed among things 10 be wished for⁷ as the amount 01
observations⁷ necessary 101· its carrying out7 does not as yet exist, and
the calculation 01 1110 effects moreover presupposes both the number and
nature of the cooperating causes accurately known. The opposite views
that even up 10 1110 present time are entertained on this subject⁷ seem
to indicate that the preparation of the question is not yet sufficiently
advanced, and it is the object 01 1110 present work to contribute in some
means to the supplying of this deficiency.

For our purpose I divide the above mentioned causes into two
groups, namely A) saecla as· produce α estangle in the water’s level (md ilua-9
inclc'rectly gsizse risa to stream& and B) saell. as inmnede'ately produce (ι stream
in ‹ssoozffs‘eq‘ztence of tlte mecltanical avtimz, which a medium already in motion
esteroi-<es on the water. To this last category⁷ (which must itself also pro-
duce a change 01 level) belong winds and the efflux 01 rivers3 further-
more every ocean—current, however it may have originated7 immediately
becomes itself such a cause. To the former category belong especially
variation of temperatum in the seawater⁷ evaporation and the meteoric
rain-fall.

A. CAUSES‚ WHICH INDIREOTLY PRODUOE OOEANIO STREAMS
THROUGH CHANGE OF LEVEL.

The form of a sphero‘l'de 01 revolution, which the surface 01 1110

ocean would otherwise assume7 is subject to small perturbations. In addi· ,

have in the first place that⁷ which results from the unequal distribution
01 1110 atmospheric pressure. According to the mean barometric pres-
sure in the neighbourhood of the Atlantic in the northern hemisphere‚
as determined by Scuonw and PoGGENDoRFF, and the barometerobserva-
tions in the southern hemisphere, collected by ΜΑΠΚΥ, 1110 surface of the
ocean at the equator appears 10 stand about 11 centimetres higher than
at the tropics3 in consequence 01 the diminishing 01 1110 barometric
