26 G. STEPHENS,

1859, he discusses this -IYAS (in Zend etc. shortened to -IS)‚ -ISTA.
In our dialects by the sinking of the S to R, here as in hundreds of
other words and forms, this degree-pair became -ARE, -ER and -ASTE,

-EST‚ etc. We can follow this R-form even in Latin, in such words as
GRAv-IOR-em for GRAV-IOS-em, etc, while in such New-Persian words
as BEHTERIN, optimas, we have the same double-comparative (TARA,
IYANS) as in our English OF-T-EN. And as we have the Latin IOR
for IOS (Sanscrit IYAnS), so we have in Greek comparatives in ION
(ιον), Sanscrit lYANs, in such words as ἐχθίων, ἔχθισιος, (ἶισχίων, (ἴισχιστος,
or ἡδίων-α, ἡδίουε, ἡδῖοινες, the Sanscrit SVAD-IYANs-AM, SVAD-IYANS-
AU, SVAD-IYANs-AS, Latin SVAv-IOR.

lt appears to me therefore that a very old real historica] floating
tradition lies at the root of this Scandian-English comparative in -AN,
-ON, — and that Erik Nilsson⁷s printed examples from 1493—1514 are
a most valuable link between the oldest yet found Swedish parchment
instances from about 1350 and the many yet living in Swedish and
Swedo-Finnish folk-talks in 1879.

As a parallel example of how honest respect for FACTS may lead
to most interesting linguistic explanationS, I will add that it was M.
Heyne (Kurze Laut- und Flexions-lehre der altgermanischen Sprach-
stamme, 8*'0. Paderborn 1862, p. 323) who, in his sketch of the old
Scando-Gothic tungs, first pointed out that the West-Frisic form of the
pronoun ΥΕ, YOU (nom. gen. acc), namely ιΪΕΜΜΑ (and -JEMNA and
JEMMAN) is of high antiquity. He shows it to have preserved an
ending extant in Vedio (YU-SME, με’, similar to the Vedic A-SME‚ we),
but dimmed in Sanscrit (YUSEM, YUYAM, Greek UMMES, HUMEIS;
VAYAM‚ VAEM, we, Greek AMMES, HEMEIS) and extinct in all the
later dialectS. As he says, this ‹JE-MMA is undoubtedly, by assimilation
from JE-SMA‚ equal to the Vedic YU-SME. — But, also by the help
of FACTS, Ι can now add that in the Moring talk of N. Frisland (see
Bendsen, p. 209) this form for YE, YOU is -JAM, JARINGE, .JAM; in
the N. Frisic speech of Fohring and Amrum, etc. it is JAM. And it is
this -Μ Which explains the enclitic 2 pers. pl. affix in the verbs, -AM
or -M, for instance HARKI'M hear-ye, LAFT'M ye-lffl. And this again
clears up the form in the same mole for YOUR, namely JAMMANS,
Which is a regular derivative from JAM. ln Sylt (see C. V. Hansen,
Wald Sold'ring Tialen) εΙΑΜ is only left as dat. and ac. YOU. In some
other N. Frisic talks JAM is nom„ dat, ac. sor YOU. In the Hvidding
district (see Lyngby, p. 47> we have the rare OM -- see ,JEMMA above
