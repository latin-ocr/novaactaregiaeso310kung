All that we have from SAVE’S hand is the above loose pencil-sketch,
very rough, made on the 13111 of Sept. 1851. He then measured the
stone. It was about 7 feet high by about 3 feet 3 11111168 broad.

All the old copies being so faulty, and Silvi: not having left one
line of help, what are we to do? We may at all events remark that the
old transcribers quietly fooyecl the UAR in KUbA ΗΑΒ MUIJIR because
it appeared necessary that the word must be ΗΑΒ. Secondly, we may
as well try to read so much of the risting as is decently legible, about
one half of the whole. If the good men of old had only taken a couple
of paper casts of each stone (cost, some ores), we should now be able
to decipher 111081 of the old blocks now partly illegible 01 altogether lost.
People gave and give what they saw 01 866, often things extravagant
enough. Only 1116 (urst can control the eye of the copyist. there the
letters are so worn and weak that we can get 110 useful impression, then
and only then can the cast be dispenst with.

We observe, then, that there are 2 marks for S, Η and ¹. — Next,
in a long inscription we must have a nominative, a verb and an accusa-
tive. Here the accusative, STIN l’lNO, is plain. The first word is there—
fore the nominative, and the verb must be between. But what was the
first word? I do not know. All the transcripts are confused. 18 1116 mark
at the extreme left a beginning-sign, a cross 01· something such, or is it
a rune‘? The next letters seem to be TRIUI, possibly a name compounded
with ΤΒΙ (ΤΒΑ). Ι1“ not, adding the first mark, the name was perhaps
ATRIUI. -— The next group must be the verb, perhaps originally RISI
(= RISTI) raised, or RITI, trrote. — The AT KPDBIURNA seems clear.
But, if 80, Kt'lJBHTRNA is an antique accusative. -— Then BRUITRSH
or BURITRSH, but more probably BRFDFR SIN, as in LII..1EGR1·:N. —-
Some runes follow, of which I can make nothing. They would seem to
speak of lx'UbBIURN as being something l MANAIM, apparently a place-
name. There was a MANSHElMs-HERAD, and therefore a MAN or
MANS HAIM, in Norway, and there may have been a MANHAIM else-
where. — The rest of the line seems to me ruined and meaningless.

Now the line below. The UAR in Bautil 18 not 011 the stone.
Bautil has KUNI ΗΑΒ ΜΠΡΙΒ, Bura: KUNA UA MUbffi, Sss'xvr. KUTI
UA MUblR. But 110 KFNI or KUNA or KUTI has been spoken of be-

fore, and there is no divisimml mark between UA and M. lt would seem,
