the straits between the Danish islauds cau occasionally display almost
the same saltness as 111 1110 Skagerack, 110 far as we 01111 judge from the
observations, taken at the statious established by D:r ,11101111 Several
causes may contribute to this, aud more especially 1110 1010011)Υ with

As regards the peculial· ‹Jonfm-mation of the sea-bottom 111 1110
parts 110 have just been considcriug, or the dcep trough-formed channel,
which extends along* the chdish 111111 Norwcgian coasts, it appcars to
me almost beyond a doubt, that it is 1110 effect of the under-current,
which has 111-010111οἂ 111010 1110 1101)(10111011 of the sediments, which now
cover the bottom of the North 0011, This however was most probably

stream of river-water, as will as 1110 under-current, 11111 111111 far greater
force than at present. The 01111000 of such a state of the strcams may
be found in the latter part of 1110 Nortli-Em·opcan glacial period. The
quantity of river-water, which, 1111011 coutcmporaneously with 1110 13111Γο

been far greater, and 111010 1111111011 111111 1111111 than 11011’,11111111101030111111-

smaller. That changes of this sort, such as chanuelling of the 003-11111111111
where the under-stream is rapid, depositions where stillness of the water

be an interesting geological prohlcm 111 investigate more accuratly the
effects of this kind, produced by under-curreuts.

The inner basius of the system l;›cfore us, the Baltic, the Bothnian
sea and the Gulf of Bothnia, unlikc those above described, are charac-
terized by 'zcozzJs'm‘m salmess at tlte sutfmfe and variable in tlw deeper

sudden variations, and differences of 0111111000, which may take place at dif-
ferent spots, are more easily equated by the effect of winds in the ex-
