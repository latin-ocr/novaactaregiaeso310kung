By researehes on the method of elimination, which has first been
given by Bsszom and developed afterwards by ΟΛυοΗΥ, M. CAYLEY and
others, I have found the fOHowing method to obtain the greatest common
measure of two rational integral funetions of ιι’.

When the greatest common measure involves a faetor of the form
(πμ, that factor derives from the existence of factm-s of the form αθ and
ω’] in both the given functions. Clearing the given funetions of such
fae‘cors⁷ the other factor in their greatest common measure will be the
greatest common measure of the new functions thus obtained. There-
fore it is evidently sufficient to treat the problem of ιῙίηᾱίηῃ tlze yreatest
common vitea-§core of tic-0 rational z'rzteyral sinuatione, ‘neither involving] a power
of ,υ as factor. ¹
