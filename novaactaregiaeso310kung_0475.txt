ΟΝ THE ANAToMY or Oexsnonfflrcs. 5

The seccondatys lateral ancl dorsal mmsis are neither seathered nor
brancl1ing3 numerous pairs in every seginent, but all perigastric.

The afferent <laets are not grown together, and enter an atriuln,
which is surrounded at the top by numerous prostate glandS. No exte-
rior penis. The opening porus of the ducts is situated in the 9⁰¹ seti-
gerous segnient.

The teste-s· are comparatively small, in 4 pairs: 111 the 9⁸¹¹, the 10⁸¹,
the 11⁰¹ &v the 12⁰¹ setigerous seg-ments.

The ‹wz'aelcccts are not with certainty found.

The ocarz'es are bottleshaped, and situated in the 10⁰¹ setiger-ons
seglnent, and attached to the dissephnent between the 9¹¹¹ &v 10⁰* segments.

The receptavles‘ are in 2 pairs, situated behind the efferent ducts
in the 10⁸¹ ὦ 11““ seglnents.

No yllandula (111111ηιὶιιζῑὶηίι.

From the above gencric characteristics it can be clearly seen that
the genus 00116)’1)(Ζι-ἰίιωΔ takes an entirely isolated place 11111161”1111111)1,111111
the question may even ariso if it. should not 111016 properly be arranged
under a separate family or subfaniily. This however, as of lesser impor-
tance, will here be left without further consideration, and Ι will in the
following only 111016 lninutely describe its organisation and point out its
most characteristic features

The aliinentary canal differs in many respects greatly froin those
of the other genera. The mouth and pharynx are, as usually, situated
in the bue-cal· and the first setigerous segrnents. In the third segment
we can traee the connnencelnent of a very muscular oesophagus, conti-
nuing as far back as to the 9ΗΧ segnient. The first five segments of the
oesophagus are each surrounded by 11 pair of very large, lobed glands,
similar to thos(= in Enclnstrmw, only larger in proportion. The 0660111111-
gus is in the 7⁰¹ setigerous seglnent furnished with two large lateral,
sacklike appendices, of nearly the same structure as the oesophagus it-
self. When the animal is alive -both sacks are very much elongated and
pointing towards the head of the worin, but when the animal is dead
and contracted, also they 1116 found to be considerahly shortened and
with their free, exterior ends pointing towards the ventral part of the
worm. A similar structure is as far as 1 11111 aware, not known to exist
in any other Limicolide genus and can therefore be considered as very
characteristic of the genus ()1²}z«>ra›‹lrila.s·. Both sacks are entirely enclosed
