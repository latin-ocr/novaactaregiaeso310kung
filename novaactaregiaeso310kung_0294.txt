borg. It should be remarked, that for a considerable time previously
uniformi and 6111111 summer weuther had prevailed, that the little wind,
there was at the time, blew out from the mouth of the river and that
the waters level was sinking. Ι11 a dista-nee of 37:300 Sweedish feet (1
Foot = 0297 metres = 11.‹3s.‹› English inehes), half of which lay within
and half without the river's mouth, Ι 011 that day took samples of water
at 10 different places 011 the middle line of the water's breadth, where
the depth is greatest. That depth in the river was 2⁵& Sweedish fathoms
(the fat-hom being = 1.ῖὸ 11161166) but in aseending the river was gra-
dually redueed to 2 fatholns. In the {jord outside 1116 mouth of the
river (Elfsborgstjorden) the depth gradually inereased from 3 to 7 fa-
thonis. At each of the 10 points one saniple was taken at least for
each fathoni of depth, beginning 111 1116 surfaee and eontinuing 10 the
bottom. The saltness ¹) per inille of each sainple will be found in the
following table, which at the same time gives the distance in Sweedish
feet of each point fron] the river's mouth, and the depth in fathoms, at
which the sainple was taken. Ι have added in parentheses the speoifie
weigth of 611611 sumple, which was first deterinined direetly with twoo ex-
66116111 areometers, ¹(ind then reduced to the speeifie weight at the tem-

perature of ᾗῇ
