14 (ἲ. sivi: ΛΜ) G. smmum,

My materiatis here 111οῑ 81111Εέ first sketch of the runes (in his
Note-book p. 13, with a transliteration in common runes, all dated 2 Sept.
1851); drawings of both body and side, pieces 1101 finally copied out
for public-&timu and a careful c‹›py of the side-risting, sent 10 me in a
101101· dated 28 Dee. 1872. 11 is Sivss‘s body-drawing and my side-draw-
ing which arc here photoxylogmpht. This 11111οκ is LILJEGREN'S N0.1065.
Si'xvn says 11 was 8 feet high.

Resides 1110 above, 11 separate bit of paper again repeats the com-
111011 mnes, But 1111011101 scrap has Siva's reading written by him in
Roman characters, and this I here give. The order in which the staves
follow each 011101 is that finally adopted by Slivn himself, in 11 letter to
me of 27 Dec. 1872:

This remark is quite correct. We have 11 similar slurring of the
K in this word7 011 the Fenne-Foss stone, Norway³)‚ which ends:

¹) SIWE'S first ske‘tch (ΝΟΜ-1111111016) gives, quite distinetly, FIHH'LFI. His
large finisht drawing, here engraved, has only a small portion of the last Ι. This
must have been a clerical error 011 Sss'xvlc's part. He evidently intended to draw
FIHIL'LFI.

³³) Sec my papcr in Archaeologia, vol. 43: »On Scanclinavian Runic Stones which

the chimncy in 1⁸75 were given 10 the. Museum, Christiania. Prof. OL. RYGH favored
me with paper casts, which establisht the general :iccuracy of the old drawing. But
for TI'PIR 111111 LIPNU (with the affixt 11111010, which we had not expected 011 so
