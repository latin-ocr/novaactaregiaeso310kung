W hen rain-water is poured down upon a part of the surface of
the 803,1110 equilibrium between that part and the surrounding ocean is
in the first instant disturbed down to the bottom3 thence a slew, general
motion of the sea-water takes place, whereby the level of the surroun-
ding water is slightly raised and that of the rainwater-stratum lowered.
But the siuking of the fresh water cannot however proceed farther, than
to about the point dctermined by the specific gravities of fresh and salt
water. Another motion is thereby caused namely 3 superficial current7 flowing
out from the fresh water-stratum in consequence 011110 difference of
pressure in the superficial strata. Should the rain cease7 results will
ensue precisely analogous to those⁷ which take place between a warlner
superficial stratum and the surrounding colder water. But should the
rain continue with unabated power, the stratum of fresh water must
continue to encrease 111 1111οκ11088, untill the consequent rise of level is
sufficient to make a surfacc-current, that carries off as much water in a
unit of time as 1110 rain yields. 111 11118 01180 11 8001118 10 110 0111110111,
that, in regard only to the differences of pressure, but a superficial
stream should be produced without any under-circulation.

The superficial currents⁷ arising from meteorological wet, frequently
have a great velocity⁷ since the sp. ,ξς-13111108 of fresh water and sea
water are very different3 111 15⁰ C. the relation is as 1:1.‹j›27‚ and at Ο0 C.
as 1:1.02s3‚ 11 1110 sea-water contains 3¹s2 p. 0. 81111, whereas the greatest

flow in a shallower bed than 111080 caused by 11031, provided 1110 maximum

are 8111311οΓ at the subsurface-strata 01 1110 shallower stream than at the
corresponding strata of the deeper, and the former ought thus to move
less rapidly than the latter. The intermixture of salt water from below
will of course influence the motion3 to that question I shall return farther on.

The rainfall at 803, 18, 38 is known, very unequally distributed‚
the greatest abundance falling to the lot of the higher latitudes, partly
