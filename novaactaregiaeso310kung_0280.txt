area to move through, the differences of pressure, which drove the sur—
face-stream, would require 10 bc about equal to those, which drove the
under-current, or the position of the warm stratum would be about in the
middle between the extremes above mentioned. But, as the case really is in
the ocean, 1110 80011011 of the surface-stream is far less than that of the
under-stream, and accordingly the differences of pressure, which drive
the superficial current, must be very considerably greater than those,
which set in motion the under-current. Or in other words: Tlce position
of the ‘curm stratum mmm be much marei· to tltzzt, which its specific gfl‘avity
would assim to it, than to the other 0111110110. Here no allowance has been
made for the change in the position of the strata, which may arise from
the vis viva of the strenuis produced.

If the water at. the surface of the ocean is cooled to a lower
temperature than the subjacent strata, the water at the surface becomes
heavier, and supposing the saltness of the lower strata not to be great-er,
it must, like every other heavier body, sinl( towards the bottom. If the
cooling over the whole locality be uniform and constant, there will re-
81111 11 vertical circulation, which will continue till all the water has rea-
ched the same temperaturc. If on the other hand only a portion of the
surface is exposed 10 cooling influence fron] above, the level of that
portion will sink below that of the rest and there will result an externa]
stream towards· the chilled place, arising from the greater hydrostatic
pressure of 1110 surrounding wnrmer water. But in 11118 01180 there arises
111 1110 8111110 time a new current, independent of the change oflevel; for
the chilled water, in consequence of its increased specific gravity, siuks,
displaces the water which previously formed the bettoni-strata and diffu-
ses itself under them. These motions, if the water in the unchilled
locality were unable to receive heat, would continue, though with less
and less velocity, untill the whole 1111188 of water had reached the tem-
perature of the chilled place.

The changes of volume, which the superficial water undergoes
from raised or lowered temperature are however accompanied by the
following plnenomena. When the superficial water 18 anywhere warmed,
its dilatation in horizontal dimensions experiences a resistance from the
adjoining strata, the effect of which must bc to cause the chief dilata-
tion to be in the vertical diret—timu this increases the differences of
pressure, which give riso to' superficial current, while the resistance to
the advancing under-current is diminished. And vice versa, when the
surface is cooled, its horizontal 00111111011011 18 accelerated by the pressure
