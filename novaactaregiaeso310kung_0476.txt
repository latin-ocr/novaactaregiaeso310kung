within the 7¹¹¹ segnient ¹). The lnuscular structure of the oesophagus is
largely developed and very 11111011 contrasting With the intestine proper⁷
which is fnrnished with inuscles in a much smaller degree.

The intestine proper is divided into two distinct parts: one anterior
beginning in the 10Νι seg-ment, 11111011 lnoader, covered with minute pig-
mented cells7 and one posterior, narrower, nearly devoid of the above
cells. Fig. 5 2(- 6. Pl. 1. The anterior lai-ger part of the intestine occupies
generally Εἴ) segnients in fnllgrown specilnens. Any large flasklike cells,
covering the aliinentary canal like those 111 J’lm‘ean›rh-rim, do not exist in
our present sorni. The under-side of the dissepiment between the 6¹¹¹ Sc
7¹¹¹ segi‘nents is entirely covered by innscnlar strata, all uniting in two
large hands⁷ one on each side of the ventral ganglion, ancl with their
posterior ends attached to the dissepiment and integuinent between the
7⁸· ἃ 8¹¹¹ seglnents. Fig. 5 l'l. 1.

The vascular system of ()r·nm·0(l*r‘llus differs already at first sight
so 001101110111111)ν froin that of any other known Limicolide, that it not
only characterizes the animal, but also plaecs it 111 an isolated position
in the system. 111 other genera a separate hear-t is not differentiated⁷
but in Oenerodrilus we find two large and distinct> pairs⁷ one in the S‘h
and one in the 9¹¹· setigerons segmenta Both communicate with the
ventral vessel.

The forking of the ‹lm-sal vessel is however that which character-
izes ()‹··22e,-0dm'la.s· the most. 111 all other Limieoles the dorsal vesse] is

two lateral branches besides the inain trunk⁷ which is continued towards

segments a perfect net ot' anastomosing bloodvessels. l‘l.I fig. 8.

The other lateral vessels are of two kinds: (1, glastr'ie, partly en-
closed in the walls of the alirnentary canal, and: b, [2⁴²*1¹22‹J‹z.5t7¹1'e‚ free 111

The former ones are plainly visible on the intestine⁷ especially
when subiet-ted to some pressure. We find of them two pair 111 every
seginent: One 111101101- situated just under the dissepiinent between the
two seglnents⁷ and one posterior7 in the first anterior quarter of every

just ns the sat—lilike appendices themselves.
