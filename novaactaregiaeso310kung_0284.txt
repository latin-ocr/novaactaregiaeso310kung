neral result of rain 01 800 then, scparately considered, ought 10 be four
surfacc-currents debouching upon the zones ill supplied with rain: two
greater, carrying cold and mixed sea-water from the poles to the tro-

to the tropics, deviating towards the western coasts.

An other and hy 110 means inconsiderable amount of rainfall is
carried into the sea by the rivers7 the mouths of which form the 00111-
1110110011101118 of 0111101118, which however usually have only a local im-
portance. In any places⁷ e. g. in the Skagerack, where the collected
mass of several rivers falls in at 0110 and 1110 801110 010011, the quantity
of fresh water can nevertheless be sufficient to give rise to streams of
such strength and extent, that they must 110 attended to in navigation,

In fresh water evaporation causes a sinking of the surfaee and a
cooling of the external stratum. then sea-water cvaporates, its saltness
is also enhanced and accordingly its specific· Weight increased from two
causes, produc-ing, as MAURY has already shown, a vertical circulation
within the evaporating locality. This vertical 011-0111011011 however soon
reaches a 1111111, 1101100111 which it cannot easily extend. In 111080 regions

powerfully3 thus the increasing of the speoific gravity is counteraeted
by the 11001, and, by other 10080118, strata⁷ that 010 heavy in 001180-

Again in localities⁷ where the snrface daily 10808 111010 heat than it re-

water⁷ and the sinking surfaee—water therefore soon meets with strata
of sufficient saltness and weight to render the circulation difficult.

Of much greater importance in the oceanic circulation is the
