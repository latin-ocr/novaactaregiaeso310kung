ΟΝ THE GENERAL CAUsEs oF THE OOEAN-CURRENTs. 51

streams caused by the Winds, the reaction-streams, and also the in my
opinion most mighty of the ocean-currents, viz: the deep strcams towards
the equ-ator produced by evaporation and rainfall.

Although Ι am fully persuaded, that many particular phtcnomena
concerning the ocean—currents, with which l have been here engaged,
might receive their proper illustration by the application of the princi-
ples above laid down, as also that the phoemnnena of the ocean-currents
in other parts of the ocean than the North-Atlantic may be explained
by them, I confine myself here to the general application of these prin-
ciples, which Ι have already made, partly because this has been sufficient
for my main purpose, and partly because my time, occupied as it is by
quite different objects, does not for the present admit of my extending
this investigation further. This last circumstance is also the reason, why
Ι have not more perfectly touched upon the works on the same subject
put forth by other investigators of nature. The observations ot' the
Water's saltness round the Swedish coasts, that I have from time to time
for several years collected, have in fact only lately led me to endeavour
to deduce from them results of more general importance, and if in sct-
ting forth these Ι had been able to pay to the literature os the subject
as much attention as might. have been desirable, I should have been
obliged to defer their publication to an undetermined time. lfthcrefore,
as may very possibly be the case, Ι may have happened to overlook any
important matter, which has been illustrated by others, l must beg that
the circumstances here mentioned may be taken as an explanation of
the omission. “

The author, whom I have principally studied, and whose name l
can not mention without a feeling ot' revence for his genius and activity,
and of thankfulness for what Ι have learned from him, is Mirm: With
the noblest devotion to his subject and led by the true instinct of the
student of nature to examine everything, he endeavoured to take into
account all circumstances, which might c‹:›ntribute, however little, to the
explanation of the currents and circulation of thc Ocean. The original
dependence of these on the unequal distribution of thc solar lieat lie
most profoundly comprehended, and being tliormighly actpiainted with
the phoenomena of the ocean, the differences between the streams, that
arise in salt and in fresh water, were well known to him. But just this
last circumstance seems to have led him, anmngst the many various
effects, into which the influence of the sclar heat on the ocean divides
