that the salt under-current 111 1116 Baltio does not fiow constantly but by
fits3 also 1116 proximity to the sui-face, which the ocean—water attains in
the Skagerack, is different at different times. These disturbances are
assuredly not merely accidental, but also of a regular and periodio oha-
ractcr. They must in the first. place be dependent on the different supply
of river-water in different seasons3 in proportion as the outflowing-
river-water isvmorc almndant, 1116 under-current will be more power-
ful, and the changes of saltness at different depths more sudden. The
effect of the variation of the rivers on the waters level must however
in these great basius be slow and easily eompensated hythe more
rap'id effects of the winds. In the summer-time westerly winds pre-
vail in the Skagerack, which in a certain degree dam up the surface-
current between the Swedish and N‹2›1·wegian coasts. But if the water
is dammcd up in the Skagcrack, it must also rise in the Baltic, and
tln·‹;›ughout the whole system of basins the thickness of 1116 superficial
freshor stratum is then increz‘tsed. The under-current can under these
circumstances be diminished, even though the supply of river-water be
inereased, and by diffusum and other causes the different strata of water
will be more and more mixed. But in spring easterly winds are more
prevalent, whereby the passage of the surface-stream out of the Ska-
gerack is faeilitatcd. By this the hydrostatic surplus—pressure of the
superficial stratum is raised throughout the whole system of basins; the
freshcr water flows out -more easily and the under-current accordingly
may assume a livclier motion. At this 111116 of the year the surface both
111 the Baltio and in 1116 Kattcgat is lowest, and the oceanic. water 111
Skagerack is then found nearer the surface than at other times, a eir-
cumstance, which already in 1870 Ι explained as caused by the winds.

strata to have assumed their normal position, so 111111 differences of spe-
