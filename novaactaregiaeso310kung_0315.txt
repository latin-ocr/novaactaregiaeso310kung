ΟΝ THE GENERAL CAUsEs or THE OCEAN-CURRENTS. 35

On another occasion I poured into the box a solution of common
salt to about half its depth and then filled up caresully with fresh
water. I then let it stand sor some hours to allow strata of different
saltness, but in perfect equilibrium, to form themselves, and then re-
peated the above experimenti with the weak stream. At the aperture of
the partition I thus obtained four opposite streams, viz: at the top one
outflowing, under Which was one flowing inward; under this was on
outflowing and then again an inflowiug stream. The difference between
this and the preceeding experiment is easily accounted for by what I
have above said about the shallowness of surface-currents, when the
difference of specific gravity is great3 in this case both the surface-cur-
rent and its reaction-strcam were so shalloxv, that the remaining depth
of the orifice was sufficient for the latter to produce its own pair of
reaction-cmrents. This phocnomenon will no doubt be met with in
nature.

Before quitting the question of the reaction-streamS, I beg to re-
capitulate partly the result of this special research, and to examine from
my point of view some circumstanccS, which may be of importance in
forming a clear notion of the ocean-currents properties and movements.

lf a free ocean-current be supposed to move under such circum-
stances, that the loss of vis viva, which it suffers from the resistance of
friction at every point of its course be always compensated from some
constantly active source, thc mass of water, which the stream carries by
in a unit of time, would continually increase3 for the streams velocity
then decreases more slowly than its mass increases (pag. 18). Although
I might not try to calculate the infiuence on the velocity of an ocea-
nic stream, arising from the conversion of a part of its vis viva into
heat, nevertheless it seems probable, that the state of the ease not
will be entirely changed by this little loss of vis viva. At all events
the mass of the moving water will be considerably enlarged by the me-
canical reaction of the stream on the neighbouring water-strata, and in
general I think we may say7 that effu-sium of Ciylzter water on tlte Oeecm
produce mach more powevful (1de more lastingy ccorreozts, than what from
their origyz'nal mass one would haue erpected. — This circumstance has
without doubt been too much overlooked, thus e. g. by MAURY, when
from the section and velocity of the Gulf—stream at the Florida pas-
sage, compared With those at Cape Hatteras he endeavours to calculate
the inclination of its under surface ¹).
