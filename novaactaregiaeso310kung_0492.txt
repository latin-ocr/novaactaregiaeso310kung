sanctiens.
If the two given functione have a common measure involving ας,

the repeated applieation of this rule and of the theoren] in I must ne—
cessarily at last lead to two functions only (liffering by a constant factor⁷
and thus the greatest common measure of the two given functions is

evidently found.

V. In order to facilitate the application of the method7 We make
the following remark as to the construction of the functions f„(112).
