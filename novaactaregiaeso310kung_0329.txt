under-current 111 1116 Atlantic, another though of subordinate importance
and more local operation, viz: the Gulf-stream's mechanical reaction.

This combination of the streams with each other is facilitated by
a cause, which has been by some asserted to 1ιο 1116 only cause os the
surfacc—streain’s conversion into 11111161-8116111118, viz: the relations of tem-
peraturc. The salt-er water of the Gulf-stream ought namely, after being
cooled 111 the higher 111111-111168, 10 sink down below the polar currents
fresher water, and this latter, as being colder, should sink below that of
the Gulf-streain in the places», where that stream retains a higher tem-
. pei-ature. If now the ascending warin stream attaches 118611Ί 118 11 16011011-
811611111 10 1116 descending cold current, it ought somewhere or 011161 in
the Polar regions 10 1186 again 10 1116 surface, whereby it is chiefly di-
luted and cooled by the melting of 106. Τ116 111 my opinion not impro-
bable theory of an open Polar sea has, as 111 known, been based upon
such a reappearance of the warin stream. With the great descending
under—current, caused by evaporation and rainfall, and to 1116 formation
of which the trade-winds may also contribute, we need not suppose any
separate stream 10 unite itself, for it 18 dependent on a disturbed equi-
librium throughout 1116 whole mass of the ocean. It seems however
probable that the cold descending surface-stream ina great measure
loses itself 111 11; if 11 should be connected with any vertical circulation
of great extent, taking place within the Polar tracts, we may find a cause
for this in the concentration of the water by the formation of 106 111 1116
1111168 and places, when and where that process takes place. But our
knowledge of the water’s motion in these regions 18 111 fact to 1111111611,

The special object of this work has not been to explain certain
particular ocean-streains, but rather to seek out the causes, in which
0061111-0111161118 111 general originate. But an important touchstone for
the correctness of a theory is the trial, whether the phoenomena, actually
presented by nature, 01111 by it be explained in a clear and satisfactory
manner. It was therefore especially with respect to reaction-streanis de-
sirable 10 endeavour to apply the theory to some particular case, where
the circumstances, which may give rise to such streams, 860111 10 bepre-
sent in abundance. The explanation of the currents 111 1116 Scandinavian
waters and in the Strait of Gibraltar would thus be a secondary result
consequent to the proving of the theory's applicability. For the same
reason it appeared to me desirable to inquire, at what 00110111810118, 11*1111
