40 (ζ). Siva AND G. STEPHENS,

15 a mistake, that the pieee is Christian. Hence my translation in many
places falls away of itself‚ and BUGGE‘S takes its place.

For in Sept. 1877 appeared BUGGE'S 4t0 -essay¹) on this iron roundle,
with a separate faesimile of the rnnes drawn and lithographt full size
by ΜΓ. C. F. Lmnssmw. The first key to the whole more mysterious
seetion was my identificaticm of the word LIUl'RITU). The next was
Prof. OLAF Rmu's excellent idea that AKU could only be z AGQ οιυη,
have. The third was Prof. BUGGE'S admirable LIRbIR, thus stamping the
whole as Christian and enahling him so to use his great learning and
ingenuity as substantially to solve this diffioult problem. In this he was
also assisted by the accident of his being a Norwegian, for his philolo-
gical instinct has recognized in certain things in the risting traces of
Old-Nom] mentiarisies, explained by the fact, also pointed out by BUGGE‚
that the folk-speech of olden Helsingland had some features in common
with Old-Nrnsrn Thus7 on the whole, his version is in my opinion tri-
umphantly happy and probable. Hard points will always remain, and I
differ from 111111 as to some words3 but in general we must, Ibelieve,
und‹11ubte(lly follow him in his cmistrnetion and translation. All honor
to him for this his latest and ripest gift to Northern linguistio seieneel

CARI, Sava made his drawings on the 4th and 5th of Sept. 1851.
They were engraved by me in my work. He himself never attempted
or 1111111151111 any translation. 1 therefore here repeat my 2 engravings of
the Ring„ but. Ι have had the runes CORRECTED accomlz'ngs to tlte copy
«sinen nx 11]] 1301111112.) I add my own ‘nen- versiomehiefly based, as I shall
show7 upon Bitooss's, where he differs from my former text (for in some
things we of course all agree), but offering some changes, perhaps recti—
ficatione, of his reading. -— Otherwise⁷ for further details⁷ I refer to my
vol. 2 p. 684, and to Bma-ss exhaustive paper.

As we see, following BUGGE'S corrected text⁷ the runes are:

¹) »Runa-lndskril'ten paa Ringen i Forsa lx'irkc i Nordre llelsingland». Chri-
stiania 187'1'. 58 pagcs, with plante.

Δ-’) On these :2 blocks the runes (like as the Ring itself) are only 2-thirds of
the full sizo, and they are sometimes more stiff than 111 BUGGE’S lithograpn to which
therefore, in this respect, I refer for minutim.
