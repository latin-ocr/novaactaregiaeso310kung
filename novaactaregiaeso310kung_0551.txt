THE FmsT BooK PRlNTED IN SwsmsH. 7-

neologisms, the language in a stage of fusion and crumbling and slur,
with distinct provincialisms, some of them old and very valuable. 11
is a little older than the year-imprint, for the Preface is dated Feb.
15‚⁷ 1493. ,

111 the following pages I have confined myself to general peculi-
arities, sufficient for the student to grasp its prevailing character. But,
in illustration, I have thought 11 useful to prefix some few similar hints
as to the magu-age, from a couple other old Swedish printed books,
passing over such well-known †hings as Gustaf I's Swedish Bible ¹).
We shall then see where we stand.

A. DEN SVENSKA TIDEBOKEN, Upsala 1525. (Reprinted by
Riks-librarian KLEMMING, ΒΜ. Stockholnl 1854). As a specimen I give
the last pages‚ a remarkable olden religious poem:

»Heel Jesu niyn h’zirre kare.

Heel ihesu alla wiirldina {ire

¹) The Swedish Bible-Society should reprint this in one handy vol. small 4ῑο,
and without the woodcuts etc, as a mark of thanks and homage to the great king
who gave Sweden its first Bible, and that students all the world over may master its
linguistic character. The price should be fixt very low. A Glossary should be added.
