drown up higher towards the suriaco, nevertheless the saltness there is
very variable. Farther 011 111 1110 Kattegat, as Iltave already mentioned,
the saltness rises to 2, and in the Skagerack to 25 ⁰ '0 and in the. Nor—
thern eorners of the Skageraek sinks again to about 2 Os„ in ecmsequenee
of the copious discharge from the Ncwwegian rivers.

If the level of the North-Sea was constant and the discharge from
the rivers continued unvariable, and there were no other disturbing cau-
ses, the water-strata throughout 1110 whole system would arrange them-
self in an unehangeable manner, dependent on the areas of the sections
of the basius and the channels that connect them. The sp. gravity
of the flowing water-strata, would then not, in my opinion, be the dri-
ving force for the streams, but it would be the ‹zlocisive cause of dif-
ferences of level, assumed by the sursum-strata all the way from Lin-
desnaes to Tornea. These differem-es, causing the sui-faee-stream, would
of course be greater between ditl'ercnt basins of the system, than between
different points within the same basin. How great then is it possible
for these differences 10 be‘? Between the North-Sea and Bottonhaf
no level ean be assumed at a greater depth than 23 metres, without its
being interrupted by land: hence the diti'erenee of level, due exclusivcly
10 specifie gravity, between the N‹1›1·th-Sea and the Northern extremity of
the Bothnian sea, cannot exceed (1:345 meti-es, assuming the sp. gravities
of the waters to be respectively 1.(’1270 and 1003, whence we obtain for
the whole distance an incline of only one in more than three milliens ¹).

The course of the streams within the above described system
of waters is however disturbed by several causes. Iliave already shown,

¹) From the above mentioned part of the Izottenhaf, i. c. from Sundswall to
Levanger in Throndhjemsfjord, the Swetlish (jcological Bure-au, in 1869 and 1870,
caused a linc to be levelled by Mr. A. l‘›‹['›]thr:LL, the Engincer, the details os which
measurements were published 111 1110 »KungL Svenska Veteriskaps-Akademiens For-
handlingar» for 1871. On this occasion it was endeavoured 10 carry 1110 work to
such a point os aeeuraey, as to control the statement coneerning the relative levcls
of the Atlantic and the Bottenhaf. The water—level in Throndhjemstjord at the mean
between ebb and flood was then found to 110 0-725 met. lower than that¹ of the Bot-
tenhaf at Sundswall. As however the two cxtremities of 1110 11110 thus determined,
have not yet been direetly compared with the mean state of the water in the two
sens, a stt-iet conclusion can not be drawn srom this 1010111111)Γ relative to the question
here agitated. Nevertheless 1110 result cxhibits a. remarkable agreement with that (le-
dueed from the speeifie weight of the waters, an agreement, which deserves a some-
what greater consideration from the circumstance, that the extremities of the 1111010-
velled were determined at just the same season of 1110 year.
