highest point should be 6⁰¹¹¹· above that at the mouth, it only requires an
incline of 1 in 90000. Now⁷ according to the 111000111011101110 01 the 10-
pographical 001110, the difference between the rivers level at 14900 me-
tres from the mouth and the mean height of the water in the fjord
amounts to 27.6⁰¹¹¹-‚ which indicates an incline of 1 in 54000; throughout
11110 distance the stream flows very uniform. If we further recollect that
a great part of the preponderant pressure at the mouth would be employed
in overcoming the friction of the outflowing fresh waterqstream, so that not
even the whole of the above mentioned 6⁰¹⁸* water-pressure should be 010110-
ble actually to drive the under-current forward‚ one cannot but conclude,
that the 011111100111011, that. the under-current described is urged forward
only 11)· 1110 difference of 0110011ὶο gravity⁷ is 111 highest degree impro-
bable7 whereas the vis viva* of the surface-current is evidently a power
01 sufficient enci-gy to be capable of the effect here to be accounted for.

A river may therefore, as regards its effect upon the sea-water at
its einbouchure7 be compared to a 11111111), 1110 11101011 01 which throws out
00 11111011 water as it sucks up from behind; the force⁷ that sets the
pump-piston in motion⁷ here corresponds 10 1110 river-waters vis viva.
This relation ought to be of practica] importance 10 many maritime
towns, situated somewhat above the mouths of rivers. The sea-water,
which for many purposes it is important to obtain, has to be brought
from a distance of some miles 10 011011 towns⁷ if it 10 10 110 taken from
the surface. But by the force⁷ we have here described, it is actually
brought fresh and clear and almost undiluted right into the towns⁷ where
it is wanted.

With respect to the 100011011-011001110 01 rivers⁷ lastly it desei-ves
to be noticed⁷ that they must play 011 important part in the case of se-
dimental depositione and delta-formations at the 1110111110 of rivers. But
as 11110 question is foreign to the object of this essay7 Ι shall not dwell
upon it.

Inclosed ocean-basins, in which thc rainfall exceeds the evapora-
tion⁷ are in fact nothing more 111011 river—mouths of 11111100οΙ1)γ large di-
111011010110 and we may therefore very reasonably expect 10 find again
there the same phoenomena⁷ that I have described as taking place at the
mouth of Geta—clf, though on a different scale. If such a basin commu-
nicat-es with the ocean only by a narrow and relatively shallow channel,
we may 0100, if we like, consider the surface-current 111 11101 channe] as 0
new river7 and the basin above it as 0 dilatation of the river. The
chief differ-enee, which the phoenomena of the streams in such a. locality
