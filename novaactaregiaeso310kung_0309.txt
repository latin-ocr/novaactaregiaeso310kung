ΟΝ ΤΗΕ GENERAL CAusss OF THE OCEAN-CURRENTS. 37

Gulf Stream, can therefore by no means have the same tendency to
diffuse itself which a fresh-water-stroam from a river has. It can there-
fore long prooeed 111 1118 form of a free-flowing ocean-current, and so
much the more as its tendency to diffusion is counteracted by its vis
inertiae in the same proportion as its velocity is great. It must for this,
like fresh-water streame in a lake, produce reaction-streams on both
sides as well as beneath itself. Undoubtedly the Gulf-Stream thus
contribute greatly towards producing the circumstance, that the Polar-
water along the Eastern coast of America penetrates in the form of a
superficial current so far to the South, and also the [nider—current, which
proceeds towards the Gulf of Mexico, must in a great measure be pro-

duced by it.

O. THE VARIOUS OAUSES OF THE OOEAN-OURRENTs WORKING
IN OOMBINATION WITH EAOHOTHER ΟΝ ΤΗΕ WATERS
OF THE FREE OCEAN.

I have in the preceeding pagos endeavoured as far as possible to
illustrate scparately each of the different causes, which give rise to
ocean-currents, as well as the various kinds of streams thus originating.
But it is self—evident, that the Ocetm-currcnts, such as they in nature
present themselves, must, both as regards their force and their course, be
determined by many or all of these causes contemporaneously, and this
the more so, the more extensive the currente are. The original prime-
movers, heat, evaporation, rainfall and wind, act in 1811111)γ with very
different average force and in a very different manner in different parts
of 1118 current's course, to say nothing of their variation with seasons of
the year etc, and of the irregularity of the winds and atmospherie pres-
sure3 this obtains especially as regards the oceanis: suriaco-currents, which
in their long course are exposed to all 1118 vast differences of meteoro-
logical circumstances, which take place on 1111Ι surfacc of the earth.
Every stream outside the region, in which its driving-force is especially
active, must associate itself with some other mrwement of the ocean,
and its course will therefore be materially intluenced by tho circumstan—
ces, which render such a combination with ‘other streams possible. The
reaotion-currents, which it causes, may again give rise to other similar
streams, and besides the reaction-streams can sometimes affcot both the
form and (1118011011 of the original current, which is moreover so essen-
tially influenced by the contours of the bottom and the shores.
