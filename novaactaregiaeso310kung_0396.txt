8 G. Sss'xvr: AND G. STEPHENS,

This stone is of course unintelligible in LlLaEeREN (No. 1683),
whose only authority is the barbarously copied fragment in the »Delsboa
Illustrata» of K. N. LENAEUS (Stoekholm 1764, svo.⁷ p. 179). In 1844, how-
ever, the Rector of Delsbo, now Hishop, 1110 Rev. L. LANDGREN, found
in the churehvard another pieee of tlte same slah, and 111 1847 forwerded
11 good drawing of both piet-es to Prof. (J. SAVE, who favored me with a
facsimile in 1860. 1 0011111 not then make it out, as little as SAVE himself.
The large lower pieee was the one given by LENAEUs3 the bit fitting in
on the top was the fragment 1111111111)ν recovered by LANDGREN.

I now fancy I 111110 solved the mysterv, and give the traeing
Heli‹s›tvped by PAQHT.

Ι think that the whole will be 010111, and that the still missing
letters mav be rensonaldv supplied, if we take the RUbUR to be yet
‹mmm›- instance of 11 feminine 111 1110 genitive with the frequent 100111
111-0111110111· -UR ending.

As, from the bend, 110 01111 see 111111 1110 rime-lines have 7208 gone
high 111 the top, only 11 eouple of letters 1110 wanting there.. The first
word wns therefore almost certainly the common mansname ANUNTR.
By the 1100011111 position of PINI 011 1110 left below, only 11 few staves
01111 want 111 that end. And us the break there is slantings, there is about
1 character t'ewer in the last left line. Thus, say, 4 011 the extreme
right, 4 (orz 111111 3) 111 1110 1111101· right 11110, 2 or 3 (01ῑ and 1 or 2) on
the outward left¹ line. The 0111101· began this last left line with letters
to be redd from below, as we see in the still left . . Abl. The phrase
HAN KARbI is 11 standing 1111110. formula, 111111 for KARbI or KIARbI
we 1101 unfr·e‹piently find KAbI or KIAbI, with the well-known slurring
of the R. Still 111010 likely, the verb was FAbI, FA H'ED, yot ready.
But the stcme-smith soon found this reading from below ineonvenient,
111111 placed the remaining words in the left line so, as 10 110 redd from
tlw top amminoni-ds, like zell the rest of tlte ‘iorem‘isttiorr

. Ι therefore believe 111111 we 011111101 go ver)v 1111 wrong, if we divide
111111 101111;
