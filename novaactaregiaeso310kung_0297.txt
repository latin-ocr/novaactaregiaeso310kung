ΟΝ THE GENERAL CAcsEs oF THE OcEAN-CURRENTs. 25

itself this increase augments in rapid progression, so that e. g. 100 vo-
lumes of river-water, at 6000 foots distance outside the mouth of the
river, will according to the same 011101111111011 have grown to 552 11011111100.
Τ11111 1110 velocity of the stream cannot decrease in the same progres-
sion, in which the volumes increase, I have before endeavoured to show;
the figures here adduced can therefore give an idea, although imperfect,
how much larg-er the stream is, which a river produces in the sea, than
the original river itself. The examination of the velocity of the stream
at different depths, 010, necessary for the complete discussion of the
question, circumstances however did not allow 1110 10 under-take.

If the under-current here described were caused by differences of
pressure, dependent on the diffcrence of specific gravity between sea- and
river-water, those differences of pressure would necessarily be very 0011-
siderable, for they would have to drive 1110 sea-water at· least 12000
Metres from the Kattegat to the mouth of the river, and when there to
raise it from the lower to the higher level, press it in through the
mouth of the river, and then drive it 5 01 6 Κ11011101100 up the bed of
the river, in doing which it would have to overcome both the friction
against the bottorn and that of 1110 powerful outflowing stream of the
river. If we now cast our eyes 011 1110 table of the specific weights ob-
ser-ved, we find, that, as regards the strata of water between the bottom
and 2 fathoms depth under the surface, the specific weight of such a
column of water, taken anywhere whatever, will be equal to or greater
than the specific weight of an equally high column, taken at the station
farthest ont from land ¹). In order 10 account for the under—current we
have also nothing left, but the difference of specific weight, which the
pillars of fluid above the depth of 2 fathoms under the surface exhibit.
If 111011 1νο assume for the pillar farthest out to sea a specific weight of
1.(1091, 011011 110 Ι observed in the Kattegat at XVinga, and for the oppo-
site side a specific weight of Loco, the difference of pressure for a height
of 2 fathoms will correspond to the pressure of 6 centimetres of pure
water, which pressure would be attained only when the two extremities
of the space were on the same level. But this last condition is impos-
sible, for the tolerably strong stream of the river presupposes a certain
inclination of its surface. In order that the level of the river at the

¹) I may add that at that scason of the year one does not in the Kattcgat,
outside 1110 opening os the fijord, meet with sensibly beavier water, than at correspon-
(Iing depth ncar 1110 river-mouth.
