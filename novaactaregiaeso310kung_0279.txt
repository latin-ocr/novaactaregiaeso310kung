If we for a moment suppose the water of the whole ocean of the
same temperature, but that an extensive portion of the surface has just
been exposed 10 1110 influence of the solar 110111, 1110 water in that loca-
lity would expand and its level would bc raised. The new level may
be supposed such as that required by the specific gravity of the warined 51111-
111111, without any lateral motion of the warnier water having been necessary.
But as the level was raised and the differences of pressure in the upper
strata increased, the warni water would presently begin to stream outwards.
Its level would thus again sink and the other water's 1150, whcreby the
equilibrium would be disturbed down 10 1110 bottom7 and the consequence
would be, that the water from below would flow to the warmed place
till the equilibrium should be restored.

If the source of 110111, 111111 produced the change, ceased 10 1101,
both the above described 1110110115, 1110 surface stream and under-stream,
would continue, though with continually decreasing velocity on account
of the continually decr-easing differences of pressure, untill all strata of
the 5111110 height attained the same temperature, and the surface accor-
dingly become everywhere normal. If 011 1110 011101 11111111 1110 source of
heat continued to operate with constant power, the water arriving from
below would in its turn be warmed and thus the motion be perpetuated.
In proportion as the warmed water receded from the warm locality in
the form of 11 superficial stream, it would part with its 110111, and at 11151
511011 1111 equilibrium would be established between all the circumstances,
that caused the two 5110111115, that. the quantity of water, brought in a.
unit of time by the under-stream, would be equal to what, was carried
off by the surface-stream. What position would the warnier water take
with respect to the colder, when this state of things came to pass?

It is clear, that, if the. two water—surfaces are at the 5111110 level,
there can be no difference of pressure to set the surface-streani in motion,
and again, if the warnier stratum assumed the position deterinined by
its specific gravity only, there would be no driving force to produce the
under-stream. The position of the warnier stratum must therefore lie between
these extremes: it must be such, that both strata are cut through by an
imaginary sui-sace, above which the differences of pressure cause 1111 out
ward-flowing stream of warin water and beneath it at under-stream of
cold. If the proportions were such, that the voluines of water, which
the two streams carried onward in the unitos time, had sections of equa]
