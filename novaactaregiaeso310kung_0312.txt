According to Pouillet's researches 011 1110 amount of 11031, radia-
ted from the sun 1), compared with Meech's work »On tlte relative inten-
S'l'tgl of tlze licat (md lifslat “f tlte sun», there must daily fall throughout the
whole of the torrid zone on 311 average 753 2) kilo-units of 11031 on
every square decimetre of surface. Let us suppose that this quantity of
11031, deducting only one fourth for atmospheric absorption, i. e. 56.5 kilo-
units on the square decimetre, is taken up by the sea-water, and that
the quantity of 11031 contemporaneously communicated to the Arctic zone
is = 03 we have 111113, with respect to the quantity of 11031 absorbed⁷
placed the 0310111311οῐ1 111 a footing far too favourable to the former re-
gion. The loss of 11031 through evaporation and radiation must be im-
mensely greater in the Torrid 111311 111 the Arctic zone. But let us sup-
pose them equal, or7 in other words, take no account of these losses of
11031 111 calculating the difference of level between 1110 two zones which
the phoenomena of 11031 would produce. We may in this case be sure,
11131 we 311311 1101 find the difference of level, caused by 11031, too little,
even though we should neglect the influence7 which the atinosphere may
have on 1110 303’3 temperature, 33 3130 that arising from the conversion
of motion into 11031; 33 regards this latter we have moreover 33 yet no
reason to suppose⁷ 11131 any greater difference of temperuture between
different regions of the ocean would be caused by it. The niaximum
diffcrence of level, which the effect of temperature could produce in 3
day between the sea-surface in the Torrid and the Arctic zones⁷ we
should therefore find by calculating the (11131311011 of the water, which 311
accession of 565 kil‹2›-units of 11031 011 every square decimetre of the
surface would produce. If we for this purpose calculute the dilatation
of 3 column of water 564 decimetres high, When the temperature is rai-
sed from 210 Centg. to 250, we make the calculation in 3 manner too
fawmruble to the greatness of the dilatation. But the dilatationis ne-
vertheless only Issss‘w millimetres.

However imperfect the observations of evaporation may be, we
may nevertlieless with certainty assume, that the change of level, pro-
duced by it in 3 day within the Torrid zone, is considerably more than
