While the amount of evaporation decreases in higher latitudes,
that of rainfall increases. Within the ice-covered regions of 1110 Α10110

an afflux to the evaporating region. Rainfall, as long as the 1011 001111-

causes 011 efflux from the region, where it falls. The other effect, pro-
duced by rainfall, consists in 0 perturbation 01 the equilibrium 01 1110

Already the difference of level between· the equatorial and 1101111·

thau the opposite difference caused by heat. By the effect of rainfall,
which may be considered as a complement to evaporation, this level-
