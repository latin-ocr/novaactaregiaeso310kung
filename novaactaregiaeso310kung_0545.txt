she first book printed in the Swedish lang-uage appeared in Stoekholin,
froin the press of Johan Smed in 1495, 11 10 111 small 4⁸⁰, 26 leaves,
29 lines to the page, in blaek letter. The only copy known 10 110 (in
the University Library, Upsala) has lost its first leaf3 but we ean give,
from the Colophon, the title:

MESTER ‚IOHANS filflsssox 1301<
AFF DYJ'xex'LsENs FRAKSTILSE.

Fol. a ij reeto begins 1110 Dedieation to JAGOB ULFsSON (Jacobus
Ulfonis) (U)RNEF0T, Arehbisliop of Upsala, by the Translator ERIK N1LssoN
(Erieus Nicolai) Canon of Upsala, who tells us that he had undertaken
this work at the express desire of that distinguisht prelate.

The work thus given 111 a Swedish dress is one of the many trea-
11000 written in Latin by the famous -JOHANNEs 6111100111, 1110 piens and
learned Chaneelor of the University of Paris, who died in 1429.

But yet another pamphlet from the same pen and by the sanie
Swedish hand followed. At 1110 request of 1110 Arebbishop was printed
by Pawel Grijs in Upsala:

Alis MORIENDI
‚waimis ‹nzsssox LARDOM 11117111Ῠ
MAN SKAL mim 1)‹''› ‘rin 512&-
LENNA SALlCTHET.

This is also in small 42⁰, 18 leaves, 22 lines to the page. Only
3 copies are known, in 1110 libraries of Upsala, Skokloster and Skara.
The last is the most complete, only a small bit being torn away 011
0110 leaf. Being by the same translator and in the same local land-
speech as the Dyafwlsens Frastilse, 1 was anxious to study and use this
also. Happily I have been able 00 to do, my learned friend Adjunkt
KARL Tossm of Skara having favored me with a oareful transcript by 1110
’own hand, page for page and line for line with the original.
