In the autumn of 18:31, chiefly 111 August- and September, my learned
and lamented friend Prof. Dr. (JARL Sam: made an antiqnarian excursion 10
examine the so-called Helsing-stones and other forn-laves in Northern
Sweden. He took eareful bnt rough copies, and it was always his 111-
tention 10 draw these out fairly and make them 111111110. Ηο had parti-
cularly entrusted to me, from time to 111110, some of his ideas thcreon.
But 1111131, 1113 frequent attacks of illness prevented him from carrying
0111 1113 1111111, and at last he was called away from 113, 27 March 1876.

1 have therefore thtmght it my duty, in honor to his memory, to
endeavor 10 make known, in his name. what he has left on this head.
Igive his own words7 where we have any. Otherwise, I have made
remarks of my own. Copies taken 25 years ago, when the stones had
necessarily suffered less 1111111 they have now, must always be 111031 va-
luable. 11130 very interesting is the new sonndpower, which Prof. SAVE
has given to the rnne ὦ , namely H7 instead of S, 1110 value formerly given
10 it. This new identification, whether correct or 110, 13 111 least much
more 30 than 1110 older one. The distinguisht Norwegian rime-lorist
Prof. Dr. SOPHUs 1310οΕ has lately examined these stenes afresh7 and
intends publishing 1113 remarks thereon. We shall welcome them. Whether
111030 two great linguists agree or not in every detail⁷ 11 will 110 111031
1113111101110 10 have the ideas of each. Seience will be advanced by the
labors of both.
