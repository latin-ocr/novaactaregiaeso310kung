move fun-ward, and also 011101 particlcs must flow to the place, whence
the stream set out3 or in other words: the motion of the stream must be
propagatcd to other 1003111103 than that, where the forces, that originally
produced it, operate. But a stream may throughout its whole course by
, mechanica] action give rise to secondary motions in the surrounding
water, and it 13 10 3110111113 of this kind that we shall now for a while
turn our attention.

Wherever a stream tlows in contact with a quiet 01- 111010 quiescent
mass of water, the moleculcs of the former will by friction communicate
a part of their motion to those of the latter. The quantity ot* the flowing
water is thus increased, while the velocity is diminished. without at
first occupying ourselves with the question, in what relation the velocity
of the thus increasing stream stands to its 111333, we may nevertheless
conclude, that a diminution of the mass in the surrounding water must take
place at every spot, where the stream connnunieates its motion to the
particles ot' that water, and carries them away in its own direction. This
diminution, like that caused by evaporation or by wind, must produce 3
change of level, 1111011311)γ 1110 equilibrium is disturbed down to the bottom,
and this disturbance again must produce an afflux of water to the place
in question, whereh)v the water carried off is replaced. The said dimi-
nution cannot evidently be cornpensated by the original stream itself, for
this would require an increase of the streams velocity, in consequence
whereof the quantity of water-particles, carried of by the stream, would
even 110 incrcased; or in other words, the level would be continually
sinking= in the part of the stream behind that, where 1110 new molecules
are set in motion. To suppose again that the void can be filled up by
new molecules of the increased stream, would be evidently tantamount
to supposing that the motion, which had caused the void, had not taken
place. On the other hand an afflux from the more quiescent water, out-
side the stream itself, both ean and must take place, which motion will
be similar to that generally brought about by the disturbance to an un-
limited depth of hydrostatie equilibrium.

The velocity of the inereased stream is another point of importanee
for the question. If we designate with W the velocity and with m the mass
of water of the original stream, which passes by in a unit of time, and
with υ and M velocity and 111333 of a following part, where it 1133 taken
