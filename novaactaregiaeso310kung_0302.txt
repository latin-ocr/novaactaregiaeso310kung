current⁷ which prefers to run deep, is rendered very difficult by the
narrow passages between the Danish Isles, and because various circum-
stances sometimes facilitate and sometimes render difficult the passage of
the under-current through these apertures‚ the supply of that current’s
water is necessarily very irregular.

The southern part of the Baltie is comparatively shallow, seldom
below 56⁰ N. Lat. exceeding 50 fathoms (89 meti-es); between the
southern extremity of Sweden and the German coast the greatest depth
is only about half that amount. Farther north to the East and North of
Gotland we find depths of above 100 or even 20‹)fatl101ns (178 and 356
met). From some experiments7 which I made in the years 1870 and
1871 on the saltness of different depths in the Baltie ¹)q it appeared among
other things7 that the saltness in samples taken at the bottom at depths
of 20 and 2ss fathoms (3ss and 4ss metres) in the shallow line between
Skane and Rugen, that is to say at the entrance of the Baltic itself, was
only 053 to (191 ⁴50, whereas 32 Engl. sea-miles to the East of Born-
holm there was water of 47 fathoms (84 11101.) depth with 144 ⁰(07 and
at 120 fathoms (214 niet.) depth to the East of Gotland with rm ⁰10
salt, and at 160 fathoms depth (285 met.) 48 Engl. sea-miles N. of Got-
land with Leo ⁰¹⁸0 salt. These facts place it beyond doubts that the un-
der-current in the Baltie is not contniuous⁷ but passes with greater or
less strength and with longer or shorter interruptions over its bottom⁷
filling its hollows.

Although the Baltic7 the Botten-sea and the Gulf of Bothnia are
but slightly separated from eachother, yet their waters at the surface
differ largely 111 saltness⁷ a clear proof that the superficial current7 caused
by the river-water7 sensibly affeets even these large surfaces7 although
it may be scarcely visible to ordinary observation. Samples, collected
froin the surface of the Gulf of Bothnia⁷ display a saltness of troni O.15 to
0435 ‘'I'U, those from B‹1›ttenhaffrom (148 to O.51 ⁰70. The surface—water
in the Baltic⁷ according to the specimens Ι 01111111111011, contained from
0.ῖῇ 10 079 ⁰(0 salt⁷ the higher number belonging to the southern part3
down to a depth of 20 fathoms (3ss met.) the water showed scarcely
any change of saltness. In the vicinity of the Danish islands the saltness
of the surface-current is, as many have observed, rapidly increased‚ be—
cause it here eomes more nearly in contaet with the under-current,
