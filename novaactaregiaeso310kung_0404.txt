sents this sound of t by GH. In his edition os the Skfme-law, when
describing this runic codex <Lund 1859, 4to, p. VII), P'rof. SCHLYTER says:
»As to the orthography 111010 is nothing remarkable, save that, instead
of G or GH inside and at the end of words, it often uses H. This re-
sults from the ancient pronunciation of many words, which, instead of
the present (ἐι-80111111, had an aspiration whose nearest representative in
writing was H. We have traces of this talk 1101 only on runic 8101108
but also in ancient skinbooks written with our common letters, such as
the oldest codices of the Westgcna Law». That K (G) should get this
sound of H (GH) is a small thing, compared with endless other linguistic
phcnmnena, amsmg others that H 118011Ί sometimes hardens into K and is
written Ρ. Ι will only mention 0110 other instance, that tlte strong] grauite-
rask 13, at the (wgsianingl of a word, has in many instances in certain di-
stricts drit'ted into H, while in others it has melted away altogether!
Imaus and at 1110 end of a word, things are worse still.

111 one word, as in the Skane-law runics its ⁴< (H) stands, save
at the beginning of words, for GH, so 1 think has the ψ (H) 011 111080

Before, in the absence of Sss'xvss’s, I add my own attempt to give
the meaning of this Malstad monolith, Ι would say a few words.

FRUMI‘NT, nominative, occurs once later on this stone written
0111 without any final -11, We are therefore 1101- justified in doubling the
R at 1110 beginning, 80 as 10 get the 1100110011) form FRUMUNTR.

STAINA blNA, a little after, is a fuller and older shape of the
STIN PINA near the end.

The great difficulty is the linc SIULFIR UARl) ΠΜ LANTI l'ISU
RI UIHA. Not only is it hard to'understand, but we cannot even guess
what this SIULFIR (or KIFLFIR) has 10 do with the other persons
mentioned 011 1110 stone. ’

As 10 sIUIAEIR. Must we take it as an error on Sj'xvss‘s part for
HHfLFllss? Prof. Bucen, who examined this monument in 1876, quotes
this word ¹) as »KIULFIR z GYLFIR». On the contrary SAVE, in his
letter to me, took what 110 redd 10 110 plainly SIULFIR as z SlU-ULFIR,
Icelandic SAE-ULFR.

ΠΜ LANTI 1)ῙὸΙῖ RI UIHA I would divide as it stands. In
Sssvn's note to 1110 ‹›f ‘27 Dec. 1872, after explaining his discovery that
¹ is S and ss etc. H, hc says that there are several things in this inscrip-
tion which he cannot master. Especially of this passus he observes:
