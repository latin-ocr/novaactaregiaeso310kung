minue-stone⁷ tho 311911 would only eost some penee and a eouple of hours'
work, — and the transcript by EKDAHL 111 L1LJEGREN is simply useless.

Henee the above drawing, however imperfect as merely a first
attempt by a non-artistie 11111111, 13 of the greatest value to us. lt even
renders possible the thought that the epigraph may be redd and the
laeune reasonably 1111911 up.

Sssvr: tells 113 111 1113 Note-book that this pieee was very mueh
worn7 and was eovered with figures of men and animals and birds7 which
he was ineapable of representing ¹). He has, however, given 113 11 man
driving a eart. 111111 2 111911 playing at 301119 table-game while a third is
otherwise employed. I only hope that it may not be impossible for us
still to reeover the interesting figure-details of this sculptured slab!

{ut I ean find among &Aves papers no single word about this
monolith, no attempt to translate it 111· grapple With its difficulties. We
have therefore not the benetit of his guidanee. But he has put-in the
runes so earesully, that we may perhaps look upon 1119111113 substantially
9011991.

As a preliininary step we must see and aeknowledge that the
formula is here very 1111911111111011, and that the words must be handled
aeeordingly. 'Sext7 as to the stzwes, we must remark that we 111119 here
2 eharaeters for S, the ’Ἴ 111111 the Ι, and that »1 (only found 111199) 13 1111-
parently used here with its olden value as ΚΕ, of whieh we have 311911
multitudinous examples.

1 would begin at the head of the worm-wind, and divide and
translate 113 follows:
