As a specimen of the endless variety of mere spelling, the substan-
tial sound being osten nearly the same, it is sufficient to remark that
the 3 s. pr. of the verb HAFFWA is: haffwer, hafwir⁷ hafwer, haffwir⁷
hawer, haffer⁷ etc.

All the above extracts are given verbatim. The »modim-uticii»,
»eorrectionr‚ >1regulutio11·», ·›·restoration» and )›normulisation)› of older mo-
numents and documents — is all a falsarium and a swindle. If we will,
we can suggest the »eorrecw form in α note, for a writer's or printer's
error is possible. But otherwise such changes destroy every truce of
archaisms aud neologisms and local variation and general progress in any
language7 and are a part of that modern school which by suppression or
mention bolsters up its absurd theories. We want things as they are,
not as they occylla to limae been in the opinion of pragmatical editors.
Hence all such corrupted reprints ¹<ire mere wastepaper, an insult to the
mother-tung, and useless asto the facts and phenomena of Compa-
rutive Philology -— old or new.

This little paper on a rare »solk-book»⁷ one intended for »menige
allmogen» in Swecleu, is more imperfect than it ought to have been, as
hurriedly written under the pressure of very hard work in many other
directions. And it has no Index. But such as it is, and with all its
faults, Ι hope it may be of some use and interest to all students of the
venerable and beautiful Swedish language in this its uufixt overgang
Pre—Reformation period.
