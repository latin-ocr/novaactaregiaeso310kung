ΟΝ THE GENERAL 01115115 or Tm: OcEAN—CL'RREN'J‘S. 21·

When a river debouehes into the sea, these plnenomena. have an
entirely different character. By the river-water, cast upon the surfaee,
the equilibrium is disturbed only 10 11 certain depth, that is, as 50011 115
the water-strata have arranged themselves as the supply of the river and
the dimensions of the ereek require. The stream of river-water flowing
over the sui-face cannot maintain its original direetion. In consequence
Of the higher level, which aeeerds with its lighter weight, the river-
water must diffuse itself towards the sides, while flowing forward. The
river-water is thus ditfused like a covering over the salt-water, dragging
with it everywhere moleeules os sea-water, where the surfaees are in
eontaet. The result of the reaction will thus be almost exclusively an
under-current, omnineneing in the open 5011 and pursuing its way under
the broad upper-eurrent of fresher water to the mouth of the river-3 if
the depth at the mouth is sufficient, the under-current will penetrate
into the river itself. At the 1110111115 of the rivers, that fall 0111 into
arms- of the sea of considerable length and gradually narrowing, under-
eurrents of this kind will be most powersul.

The difference, that exists between the sea and lakes with
respect to the streams caused by rivers, 15 sufficiently explained by
what has been said above. There 15 however one additional circum—
stance to be taken into consideratum, namely the effect, that the ten-
deney to diffusion between fresh and salt water may produce. This
seams to be of a double character. In the first place it is clear, that at
the moment the streaming river—water diffuses itself in the salt-water, it
eommunicates 10 1110 latter its motion without suffering so great a loss
of vis viva, as takes place, if the motion 15 0111150(1 exclusively by fric-
tion, as in a fresh—water lake. 80000111)Υ 1110 (1111051011 causes a continual
change in the hydr-ostatical equilil.»rium. If in fact we suppose a stratum
of fresh-water to lie upon the sea-water, the level of which with respect
to the latter 15 (101011111110(1 by the specific weight of the water, the limit,
where equilibrium prevails, will by the diffusion be brought lower, and
at the same time the pressure in the immediately superjacent levels in—
ereased. The final effect of this on the motion of the water-strata would,
I think, be 10 increase the power of the surface stream, and thus also
to strengthen the under-current.

For fuller illus-tration of the effect, that river-water has upon the
sea, I herewith communicate the prineipal results et' the experiments I
made on the ἵ)ῃι Aug. last year at the mouth of the Gom-Eis at Gote-
