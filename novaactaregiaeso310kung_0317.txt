ΟΝ THE GENERAL CAUsEs or THE OCEAN-CURRENTS. 37

Gulf Stream, can therefore by no means have the same tendency to
diffuse itself which a fresh-water-stream from a river has. It 0311 111616-
1016 long proceed in the form of a free-flowing ocean-current, and so
much the more as its tendency 10 diffusiori is *counteracted by its vis
inertiae in the same proportion as its velocity is great. It must for this,
like fresh-water streame in a lake, produce reaction-streams 011 both
sides as well as beneath itself. Undoubtedly the Gulf-Stream thus
contribute greatly towards producing the circumstance, that the Polar-
water along the Eastern coast of America penetrates in the form of a
superficial current 30 131 10 1116 South, and also the under-current, which
proceeds towards the Gulf of Mexico, 1111131- 111 3 great measure be pro-

duced by it.

O. THE VARIOUS CAUSES OF THE OOEAN-OURRE'NTS, WORKING
IN COMBINATION WITH EACHOTHER ΟΝ ΤΗΕ WATERS
OF THE FREE OOEAN.

I have 111 1110 preceeding pages endeavoured as 131· 33 possible to
illustrate separately each of the (1111610111 0311303, which give rise to
ocean-currents, as well as the various kinds 01 streams thus originating.
But it is sels-evident, that the Ocean-currentS, such as they in nature
present themselves, must, both as regards their force and their course, be
determined by many or all of these causes coi1temporaneously, and this
the more so, the more extensive the cur-rents are. The original prime-
movers, heat, evaporation, 131111311 311(1 wind, act in reality with very
different average force and in a very (1111616111 manner in different parts
of 1116 011116111’3 0011136, to say nothing of 111011 1311311011 with seasons of
the year etc, and of the irregularity of the winds and atmospheric pres-
sure3 this obtains especially as regards the 00631110 31111306-0111161113, which
in their long course are exposed to 311 1116 vast differences of meteoro-
logical circumstances, which take place on 1110 31111306 011116 earth.
Every stream outside the region, in which its driving-force 13 especially
active, must associate itself with some other movement 011110 ocean,
and its course will therefore be materially influent-ed by the circumstan-
ces, Which render such a 0011111111311011 with other 311631113 possible. The
reaction-currents, which it causes, may again give rise 10 011161 311111131
311631113, 311(1 besides the reaction-streams can sometimes affcct both the
form and direction 01 1116 original current, which is moreover so essen-
tially influenced by the contours of the bottom and the shores.
