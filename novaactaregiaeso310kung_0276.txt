rents are the consequence. The heavier water goes towards the lighter,
and the lighter whence the hea-vier comes; for two fluids differing in sp.
gravity, and standing at the same level, can no more balance each other
than unequal weights in the opposite scales of a true balance.» We see
that according to this⁷ view the first impulse to the stream arises from
the heavier water, which, as standing at the same level as the lighter,
in consequence of its greater weight displaces the latter in the deeper
strata. In this manner MAURY endeavours to explain the under-current
in 61111116, which unite oceanic basins of different degrees of saltness,
and this explanation is accepted by CARPENTER and others.

It seems to me, that 11116 explanation of 1116 1111(161·-(·11116111, 11111611
has moreover been extensively applied to 6116111116 111 1116 open ocean,

oceail's surface, and that the following theorems, however simple, deserve
especial attention, in as much 116 that they must be the foundation of a
correct comprehensim] of the 1111(611(1111611611.

lzo) When the equilibrium between two masses of water has been
disturl:›ed, two cases are possible, 1111111611ν a), when the equilibrium is
disturbed throughout all the strata down to the bottem and b), when the
equilibrium 16 disturbed onl)v to a certain depth belew the surface. The
first 61166 happens, when the specifice gravity in both masses 16 1116 6111116,
but the level different, or the level the same, but the sp. gravity, at least
in the npper strata, different. The latter 61166 presupposes, that the spe-
citic weight in both masses is in the lower strata the same, but different
in the strata situated above a certain level, and moreover that the
thickness of these latter strata is 1111616611Υ 116 111611 specific gravities.

of different specifie gravity, there will be a differenee of pressure, which at

however the lighter water be 66 11111611 raised, that. the difference of
pressure at its greatest depth vanishcs, then at any point above that
depth the lighter water will produce a greater pressure than the heavier,
and the difference increase 116 we approach the sursace, but the 611111 of
1116 differ-erices of pressure of the two strata will be less 111 1116 1111161

320) When the equilibrium between two 111-116666 of water is distur-
bed, the motion of the particles will be such as to restore the equili-
brimn at the least possible expense of time and action. For a given
difference of pressure the required motion will oecupy more time, when
