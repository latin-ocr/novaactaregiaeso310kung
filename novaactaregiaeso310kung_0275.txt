pressure from that latitude to the pole it ought at 750 N. Lat. to stand
about 11 centimetres and at 74⁰ South Lat. about 40 centimetres higher
than at the t-ropics. If the difference in the atmospheric pressure were
absolutely constant7 this differencc of level could not give rise to any
011-03111, but the water-particles of the inclined surfaces would move with
equal facility in any direction. Only when, from some other cause, the
water streams from one latitude to another, can the difference of the
mean barometric pressure have a modifying influence on the motion of
the stream. The streams, that flow from the tropics towards the poles,
will have their movement very slightly facilitated, those flowing in the
opposite direction will he 1013101001, but accelerated again, as soon as
they have passed the tropics

Every variation of the atmospheric pressure must cause water to
110111 from one place 10 another3 but these changes, being only occasional
and of short continuance, can have only a trifling effect upon the real
oceanic currents⁷ although they may have amore considerable temporary
influence on the streams in straits⁷ which unite separate oceanic basins
with eachother.

The changes of level, caused by hcat and cold, evaporation and
rainfass, on the other hand may give rise to constant movements in the
sea-watien for these operate with an average constant difference of force
on different portions of the ocean? Ι have already 03101, 11131 they cause
streams in consequence of changes in the level of the sea. They how-
ever also alter the volume and specific gravity of the sea-wate1·‚the
latter partly by changing its saltness and partly its temperature.

Each of these changes has its effect upon the ocean’s circulation⁷
and I cannot consider it as 3 matter of indifference, whether we assume
one or the other of 1110111 30 the immediate cause of the resulting
stream. MAURY‚ and many others after 111111, have pointed out as the
cause 1110 variation of the specific gravity of the sea-water. When for
example he in the chapter: «The origin of Currents» epitomizes his view
of the subject, he uses the following words: ¹) «If we except the tides
⁷ and the partial currents of the sea, such as those which may be created
by the wind, we may lay down as a rule7 that all 1110 currents of the
ocean owe their origin to differ-once of specific gravity between sea-
water at one place and sea—water at another3 for wherever there is such
a difference, . . . .. it is 3 different-c that disturbs equilibrium and cur-
