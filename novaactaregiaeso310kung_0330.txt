respect to the course of the ocean-currcnts, we should arrive, if we en-
deavoured to form an idea of what metiens those causes of currents,
which in the earlier part of this cssay we have treated separately, would
produce in the free ocean. It here appeared, that only in the case, when
we take into account all the above named causes, these motions seemed to
correspond with those, presented by reality in a perfect segment of the
ocean, e. g. the Atlantic between the equator and the North-pole. As
now these forces are evidently of such a. nature, that in a complete segment
of the Ocean they must all come into operation, this circumstance appears
to me to be a proof of the correctness of the view taken. I have also .
taken the opportunity to point out the need of thoroughly investigating
certain data, which have hitherto been much neglected, as being neees-
sary for the quantitative determination of the causes of the streams,
which should be one of the prineipal problems of hydrography. I place
among these 111 the first place the amount of evaporation and, wherever
it can be carried out, the determination of the mean water-level in diffe-
rent portions of the ocean.

lf we take a general view of the effects, produced upon the ocean
by the different forces which originally set its water in motion, we find,
singularly enough, that each of these forces produces both of the kinds
of stream, of which I have been endeavour-ing to explain the essential
difference viz: a surface-stream, caused by a limited, and a deep-
stream by an unlimited disturbance of the equilibrium. Heca produces a
surfaee-stream by warming the water and a deep—stream by evapora-
ting it. Cald can produce an under-current by the contraction and still
more by the concentration of the water, but it then leaves at the sur-
face a tendency to disturbance of equilibrium, which shows itself in the
form of a surface-stream on the melting of the ice. Raz'nfczll causes a
deep-stream as its immediate consequence and a surface-current of
lighter water as a secondary effect. isim&¹ occasion direetly surface—
eurrents, and deep-streams by changing the level. Hic-ers, and similar
constant out-pourings of lighter water, give immediately rise only ’10
surface-streams, but produce uinler-currcnts by mechanical reaction;
streams of this latter kind often accompany even the above mentioned.
The specific gravity of the water plays in all these cases a very varied,
but in some or other respect always'important part. It usually deter-
mines the level of the water-strata, but not always. As to the origine
independcnt of the variatitms of spccilic weight are especially the
