ON THE GENERAL CAUSEs OF THE OCEAN-CURRENTS. 45

essential condition for the circulation⁷ caused by the united effect of
evaporation and rainfall7 taking the form here described7 is the tempera-
ture of the water 111 1116 less evaporating region. Ι wc supposed e. g.
that the warin surface-current preserved its once assumed temperature,
instead of cooling in the higher latitudes, the whole mass of water must
ultimately be raised to a high temperature⁷ in which case it seems pos-
sible that the molecules concentrated by evaporation might sink down,
so that the circulation went out from the most heated place into the
deep. The afflux would then take place from the surface7 as is the case
in the llflediterranean⁷ where the course of the stream is confined to
about the same latitudes7 instead of crossing them as in the ocean. This
mode of circulation in the Mediterranean is however also especially sa-
Voured by the small dimensions of the opening for the admission of
the inflowing water relatively to the surfacc exposed to evaporation.

I have endeavoured to show⁷ that in the hotter part of the ocean
in consequence of evaporation⁷ rainfall and 11631, there ought to bc for-
med a broad and deep hollow filled with warni and salter water; that
this hollow is 6011111111311)ν filled up from below by two deep streams ot'
cold water7 0116 from each pole; that the greatest part of the confluent
water evaporates between the tropics7 but that another part flows back
again over the edges of the hollow in the form of a shallow broad
stream of warni water, and that this warm current ought at 3 certain
latitude to be met by another superficial current of 00111, but less salt
water7 arising from the perturbation os the superficial stratas cquilibrium,
which the rainfall in the high latitudes had left as one os its consequen-
ces. These results show⁷ as regards the course of the snrface-streams7
a by no means unimportant deviation from the phoenomena, which the
ocean actually presente. Let us therefore see, whether we have taken
account of all the most essentia] forces, the combination of which pro-
duces these curreuts.

By the rotation of the Earth the streams p1·‹1›ceeding towards the
poles receive 311 impulse towards the East, those desc-ending from the
poles an impulse towards the West⁷ and even in this a reason is appa-
rent7 why the ascending warni and descending cold streams should be
able to pass by each other⁷ each on its own side of the channe]⁷ in-
stead of coming in collision; but there remains an other and probably
still more active force to be taken into consideration. The broad belt
of warmed water between the tropics is attacked by the trade-winds in
two concurrent directions, viz: from N. E. and S. E. The water's ten-
