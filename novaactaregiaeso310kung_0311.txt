ΟΝ THE GENERAL CAUSEs oF THE OCEAN-CURRENTS. 39

is there set free when the evaporatcd vapour is condensed, is again in
part communicated to the sea by the winds, or, if one prefer 10 say so,
serves to reduce the loss of heat caused by evaporation. ‚In 001166-
quence of the rapid changes of the atmospheric strata over the 006311-
surface the quantity of warmth, thus afforded by the winds, ought not
to be destitute of effect. In other regions again 1116 surface of the sea
may from an analogous cause suffer a loss of heat. Lastly the conver-
sion of motion into heat has in various ways an effect 011 1116 sea. The
streams, that circulate there, are continually resisted in their motion by
resistance of many kinds. Thus the whole of the very considerable
force, required to over-come this resistance, 16 converted into warmth,
as also on the other hand every raindr‹2›p, that falls upon 1116 sui-face,
must there set free a certain amount of heat, when its falling velocity

an undulatory motion and on their cessation there remains, as 3 001166-
quence of this motion, a certain amount of 11631, which the ocean 1136
acquired, unless it should merely have served to compensate the 1066 of
heat through evz‘iporation. '

Again to determine the ‹lewes-svm af lta-«fl caused by ciwrstoratz'un
two methods are available: either to etuleawur τι) (Ζυΐσιίηίηθ it bg] direct
observatiam, or to calculate it frma memorabissical 0(ts-errationis- (ψ’ the localitgs,
having] first fully ascez‘tained tlte law of evaporatian. The first process has
been tried, but. the observations are, it is known, 60 sew and conducted
in such a manner, that the important question of evaporation from the
ocean's surface must 36 yet be considered as unanswercd.

The estangle “f leuel, insulting( from tutins'scll, would at first sight
appear relatively easy to bc determined. But as in this case the water
received from rivers and from the melting of 106, produced by the snow-
fall in the polar regions, must be taken 11110 account, this question also
becomes difficult. We thus find, that no one ot' these three principal
questions can in the present state of science 110 answered, without leaving
a very large margin of nncertainty. An especial hindrance in this case
is our want of accurate knowledge 36 10 1116 amount of evaporation, a
quantity, which would be so necessary to know both for 116 own sake
and for the calculation of the warming and cooling of 1110 006311 snr-
face. We have accordingly no other alternative, than 10 attempt 311
approximate estimation of the said quantitics' greatest or least value and
to see what conclusions may be drawn from them.
