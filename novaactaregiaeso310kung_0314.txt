fed from the evaporating basin itself, thus discharging a quantity of
water corresponding to the surplus carried thither by the surface-stream.
This undercurrent penetrates trough the basius mouth into the ocean
and there sinks 111 consequence of its greater weight. Provided the di-
mensions of the mouth afford sufficient 100111 for this double circulation,
the specific weight of the water in the basin 01111 probably not attain
such an amount, that a real surplus of hydrostatic pressure should take
place from that side, were it not helped by the excess of water carried
thither by mechanica] reaction. “

Τ1110 appears to me likely 10 110 1110 true explanation of the
double stream in the strait ol* Gibraltar. Τ 110 theory, which attempts 10
account for the under-current exclusively by the greater specific gravity
of the Mediterranean's water, is besides destitute of the necessary soun-
dation, as long as we know nothing about the relative height os the
levels. The chief difference between the currents of Gibraltar and 1110
Sound appears to 1110 10 110, that in the first case the surface-current
flows from a locality with constant level to 0110, where the level is al-
ways sinking, whereas in the second case it flows from a region, where
the level is always rising, to one, where it 10 constant.

111 further confirmation of this view l may 110 allowed to adduce
an experiment, which I made to convince myself, that a double stream
of this kind may be produced independently of the specific weight of the
water-strata. In a box of 12 decimetres length and 1¹ '2 decimetres broad
and deep I set up for the purpose a vertical partition iu the middle,
in the upper part of which was an olziening, about ¹f'2 decimetre broad
and 1 dec. deep. The box was filled with fresh water and a stream,
yielding only about- 100 cub.cent. per minute, was conducted to one end
of the box behind a pack of hards thcre put in, which caused the stream
to be uniformly distributed, at the other end of 1110 box the water esca-
ped through a 11010 111 1110 sursace. Τ11011 011 immersing a glass rod,
wetted with a solution of aniline, perpendicular to the bottom of the
box, I could by the diffusion of the colour obser-m the slight motion of
the water at any depth. When the rod was placed at the opening in
the partition, a constant under-stream was observcd to fl‹›w from the di-
vision of the box, from which the water escaped, to that, into which it
was admitted. This stream was 111011 analog‹;›us to that, which cxists
between the Mediterranean and the ocean, with merely the differcnce,
that in this case the water flowed instead of evapomting from the sur-
face, and that no salt was present.
