ΟΝ THE GENERAL CAUSEs OF THE OCEAN—CURRENTS. 39

is there set free When the evaporated vapour is condensed, is again in
part communicated to the sea by the winds7 01, if one prefer to say 80,
serves to reduce the loss of heat caused by evaporation. In conse-
quence of the rapid changes of the atmospheric strata over the ocean-
surface the quantity of warmth, thus afforded by the winds, ought not
to be destitute of effect. In other regions again the surface of the sea
may from an analogous cause suffer a loss of heat. Lastly the conver-
sion of motion into heat has in various ways 311 effect on the sca. The
streams, that circulate 111818, 318 continually resisted in their motion by
resistance of many kinds. Thus the whole of the very considerable
force, required to over-come this 1881813308, 18 converted into 1131111111,
38 3180 011 the other hand every raindrop, that falls upon the surface⁷
must there set free a certain amount of 11831, when its falling velocity
18 stopped. The vis viva, which the winds 00313111, 8818 1118 008311 into
an undulatory motion and 011 111811 0888311011 there 1811131118, 38 3 001188-
quence of this motion, a certain amount of 11831, which the 008311 1138
acquired7 unless it should merely have served to compensate 1118 1088 of
heat through evaporation. “

Again to determine the ‹lq11·es·.s·i0n of lez-el caused by 0110131111111171ν
two methods are available: either to endmwam to ‹leternmze it (uss direct
observatam, 01 to calculate it from meteomlrstafiva! mltswrmztions of the locality,
having] first fully ascertained the law of evaporatiutz. The first process 1138
been tried, but the observations 318, it is known7 80 sew and conducted
in 811011 3 manner, that the important question of evaporation from the
ocean's surface must 38 yet be considered as unanswered.

The elzangse of level, resultings from “slltsfslsf, would at first sight
appear relatively easy to be dctermined. But 38 111 11118 0380 1118 water
received from rivers and from the melting 01100, produced by the snow-
fall in the polar regions, must be taken into 3000331, this question also
becomes 0111110311. We thus find7 that no one of these thrco principal
questions can in the present state of 80181108 be answered7 without leaving
a very large margin of uncertainty. An especial hindrance 111 this case
18 our want of accurate knowledge 38 to the amount of evaporation, 3
quantity, which would be so necessary to know both for its own sake
and for the 0310111311011 of the warming and cooling of the ocean sur—
face. We have accordingly no other alternative, than to attempt an
approximate 881-1111311011 of the said quantitiesy greatest or least value and
to see what conclusions may be drawn from them.
