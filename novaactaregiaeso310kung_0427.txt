THE FORSA RING
IN HELSINGLAND, SWEDEN.

It is now more 111311 3 dozen years ago, when 16311111110108)ν was
so young and we were all so inexperienced in this new arehaeologieal—
philologieal seience, that 1 hastily 1101111Υ 0111 my short paper¹) on the
Forsa Ring. This remarkable pieee, 011 whose iron surface 3 cunning
rune-smith has puneht-in 245 613166, I had never seen, nor have Ι 10
11116 day. But it had been examined and earefully copied by Prof. CARL
SAVE, at that time the greatest living Runologist. The only transcript
that could 601116 11110 competition with his, was that by ARENDT (1806).
But it is no secret that all the older 1111116 drawings are usually 111016 01
less doubtful, often lamentably 1116011661, and the general excellence of
ARENDT'S work was then not suspected ²). No authority was at that time
equal to Sl'xvffs as a {cor-king] runologist, one used to handling real stenes
and 011161· 1111116 old-laves, not mere printed copies. I therefore adopted
Sssvss's text. Just 60 now with Seruus BmGE. He has become 311 111116-
1110116 111116-111311, and has worm on tha Rings [welf. So I now follow him
loyally and blindly, as I then did SRVE. And this the 111016 36, 111 1116
treatment and translation, he of 6011166 1136 1116 advantage of building-
on all who have gone before, making use of their good »hitsw and
avoiding their mistakes, as every wise man 111311 does.

Not only has Prof. 1311666 shown that 111616 were some serious
errors (no fewer than 10) in the copy 1 followed (SAVE's)³), but I went
011 3 false principle, that the Ring was a heatlzen 16116. This was the
universal belief then, and misled 1116. BUGGE has made it clear that this

folio. See vol. 2, pp. 684-9*

²) ARENDT'S drawing of the Hing is so good that, 36 compared with Prof.
BEGGE's, it has only 3 faults.

³) SAVE could only give some sav hears to the Ring, as it hung on the door,
and had then never seen ARENDT'S beautiful copy. BUGGE had the Ring for many
days in his own hands, and was familiar with Anssan's drawing.
