Prof. Bmffle (p. 51) fixcs the date of this piece at about 1150, or
between 1150 and 1200, which all the circumstances render likely.

I refer to him for other details, an enquiry when 'l'ithes were
introduced into scandinavia and especially into H‹‘=lsingland‚ a list of
certain words in olden Helsingland probably connected with old Norwe-
gian, an exfflnination os the term LIUbRITR with the remarks of Prof.
K. MAURER thei-con, etc.

He winds up by remarking (p. 53) that this Ring is the oldest
extant Legal Document yet discovered in Scandinavia.

111 conclusion 1 hog to add that my friend A1na11ue11sisP..J. LINDAL
has⁷ with his usual kindness⁷ superintended the passing of these pages
thro the press 111 Upsala. 111 this way the)v are, Ι trust, more or less
free from lnisprints. For this, and all his other favors, Ι beg to give
him my hearty thnnks. ¹
