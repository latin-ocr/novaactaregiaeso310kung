SOME nume smnus. 9

As we have 111111(- instances of both HRUbR and RUl'R, masc.7
HRUbA and RUIJA, seur, — nothing being more 00111111011 than the di-

11100110 absence or presence of the Η, — so RUbUR is here the same
as HRUbUR, a u·0man.s·-7zame in the glenitz've, as we all see from the fol-
lowing HANAR = lter, gen. sing. fem. rin appo-sitiam.

UAR-IU can only be a place-name, added either because her fa-
mily estate was there, or else 10 distinguish this RUTHA srmn some
other lady of the same name. The variations of (this word for ΕΓ, vile,
iland) ΛΠ are manifold in our old dialects⁷ especially 111 the oblique cases.
We have runic -IU elsewhere as a dat. sing. ll'here this VAR-EY was I
cannot say. An iland so called is in a channe] to Bindalsffiord and Fol-
den⁷ 111 Naumdal, Norway. This7 by marriage and removal, onas] have
been the spot intended. But there must have been other VARAEY&
place-names beginning with VAR were common. Perhaps there was a
VAR-EY near Delsbo⁷ 01· in Helsinglaud⁷ all which country, as we know,
swarms with lakes and ilands.

Note-book but from a loose pen-and-ink drawing by 111111, from which he
intended to make a fair copy for publication. He has a runic translitera-
tion in his Note-book. On a separate piece of paper he has written
out ‘the inscription in Roman characters. thus:
