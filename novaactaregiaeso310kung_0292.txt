that 1110 river—water, streaming onward from behind, could constantly
supply the loss, caused by the outflow, and preserve the level unchan-
ged. Thus the cause of the under—current, which in the former case
was occasioned by the reduced hydrostatic pressure of 1110 superficial
water in consequence of 1110 sinking of the level, does not in this case
exist. Hence the difference of 0110οἰΗο weight between river-and sea-
water ought here only to produce differenccs of level, which also should
be constant as long as the supply of river-water is continued and con—
stant. I look upon the under-current, which, in these cases, very di-
stinctly appears, as a reaction-stream, to be accounted for on the gene-
ral principles, above laid down for the explanation of such streams. But
the 0111110 01111000, which produce an wider-current at 1110 1110111110 of rivers,
must also give rise to an under-current in the channels, whereby separate
ocean-basius discharge their superfluous fresher water into 1110 ocean.

This seems 10 be 1110 place to say a few words on the 1011011011-
011·0111110 111 lakes 110 compared with those in the ocean. Our knowledge
of the former is indeed very scanty, nevertheless the general experience
we have of streams in lakes would seem to justify our assuming, that
the under-currents, produced by thereaction of rivers in lakes, are far
inferior in intensity 10 those produced in the sea. that then, it will
be asked, is the cause of this difference, if the under—current in the sea
is not caused by difference of pressure, depending on the different spe-
01110 wcight of the water?

In the 11101 place the changes of level, occasioned by 1110 pouring
of fresh water into fresh, cau only produce such disturbances of equili-
brium as extend all the way 10 1110 1ς1(’1110111; 11111 1110 movements, that re-
sult from this disturbances, ought not, as Ι have just said, 10 be follo-
wed in any great degree by any rcaction-stream. Sec-ondly, when a
river falls into 11 lake, the moleculcs of river—water have no reason to
change the (111-0011011 of their motion, unless obliged by the contour of
the shore. The river-water therefore proceeds as a distinct stream in
the upper water-strata, the particles of which it sets in motion by fric—
tion. But the reaction-stream, thus caused, must show itself in 1111 afflux
of water from the sides as well as from below, and in many instances,
in consequence of the lake's form and depth, the requisite quantity of
water 01111 111001 easily be brought 10 1110 stream 111 1110 first mentioned
manner. Accordingly the reaction-streams, resulting from rivers, will
in fresh-water lakes chiefly take the form of eddy-streams on each side
of the almost strait stream of river-water.
