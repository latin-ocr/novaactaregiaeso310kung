These staves Ι now divide and interpret as follows:
1. UKSA, ac. s. m. An 011², one Oa‘.

TUIS-KILAN (Ξ TUIS-GILLAN), ac. s. 111. TWICE-GILD‚full-ymon
and strony, zcortlc 2 common bea-3253. Thus I here follow ΒΗΟΟΜΑΝ, LILJE—
GREN, RYDQUIST and BUGGE, and banish our friend the god TU (TY, TYR)‚
who appeared here in my first version. Cannot help it. Peace be
with him!

ΑΗΚ, EKE, aml.

AURA, ac. pl. 111. OHES, (altrices of veile-er.

TUO, ac. pl. 111. Tm). I again must object to BUGGE’S fancy of
transliterating the plain runc for O by q (which he makes to be a kind
of masal A). The rune for A inust be given by A, the stave for O by
O, however we may theoria) (often, as here, unfoundedly) as to the
pronunciat-ion of this or any other letter in certain cases. All who like
may accept BL'GGE‘s theorieS. Ι and most others decidedly reject them.
But lie has quite simply no right to bolster them up altering the runic
values of any letter. -

STAFA, inf. (One shall) STA Vlffifii· as with (z stroke of tlte ‚Judge's
staff, ἄρατε, [erg] as α mulct, dcnmml as (z fine. Ι take STAFA here to be
the usual N. Ι. verb so frequently employed for — to ordain, fix, de-
termine, sentence to any fine or punishment even death itsclf. As BUGGE
truly says, this is perhaps the hardest word in the whole risting. Ι now
divide STAFAT as STAFAVAT. Rumon thinks this is inadmissible, as,
in the next place where it occurs, there are 3 points between the F and
the,following A. But there are hundreds of examples on our runic pieces
of much greater freedoms than this, so necessary was it to spare space
or hard cutting-labor or both. And, when the 1·une-sta1nper came to the
other place

ATASTAF AI'KALT
how was he to proceeds) If he had written

ATASTAFA ς 11111111
it would have been much harsher and more unintelligible. lncluding the
twice-taken but once cut L in TUISKILAN, there are 8 letters thus
twice redd in the usual runic way on this roundel. The whole sentence
is undoubtedly in the accusative, and I take STAFA to be the govern-
ing verb (with the indefinite man mmm-t or one shall understood as the
nominative, a construction so very common in our old tungs). Bucam
divides STAF AT FURSTA, and takes sTAF to be a hitherto unknown
word meaning α fast (fast as a staff> sum ων norm arsine or mmlct. STAF,
with him, is therefore a second accusative, in apposition with UKSA —
