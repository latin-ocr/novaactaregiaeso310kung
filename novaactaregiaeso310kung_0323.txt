We see here that the dilatation of sea-water at the temperatures,
which take place iu the superficial strata of the warnier seas, is not so
much greater than that of pure water, altlmugh at low ternperatures, which
even there may be met with deep under the surface⁷ it. can be 10
times more rapid. Evaporation on the other hand at low temperatures
is small, but increases very rapidly with increased temperatum. The 111-
fluence of the sea-salt in hindering evaporation is more sensible at low
than at high temlseratures, although that influence of 3¹¹2, p. c. salt is
111 general ver)v tritling.

Leti us suppose the whole ocean 10 have had a temperatur-e of
for example —l— 4⁰ Ceut.7 and that the unequal distribution of the solar
heat were just beginning to influence the sui-face. As the evaporation
of the water would at such a temperature be slew, whereas its dilata-
tion would already be tolerably rapiet, the first effect of the heat ought
chiefly to be a surfaee-eurrent from the equator towards the poles7 follo-
wed by an under-circulatim] in the opposite clirection⁷ as I have shown
in explaining the streams produced by heat. This under-circulation will
