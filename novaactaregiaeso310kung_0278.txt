The most immediate and essentia] consequence of such differences
of specific ἰ(311111711117 between different parts of the ocean is then defferen-
‹sas› of level, which differences however subsequently give rise 10 super-
ficial streaius⁷ whereby tlte ligslzter water· <lis-places· tho leem-ier. By these
8110111118, 111 consequence of the 8111111111088 01 their 80011011, 1110 disturbed
equilibriuni 01111 011117 be restored slowly7 and their 0011111111111100 may the-
refore be considerable both 118 regards time and extent. If the causes,
which produce the change of specific gravity operate in a constant man-
ner⁷ 110111 the differences of level and the consequent streams will be
constant.

When the equilibrium of a 1111188 01 water is disturbed by causes,
which do not alter7 or 111 101181 (10 1101 (111111111811 the water's specifie gra-
vity7 the disturbance must extend 1111 the way to 1110 110110111, and the
differences of pressure 111 1111 (10111118 bcneath the lowest level 011110 sur-
11100 will be 01111111. The equilibriuin is then restored by a general mo-
venient of the whole 1111188, which will however be the less visible in
proportion 118 the 1111188 of water set in motion is greater. We 11111το

observed in 81111 and fresh water. For of 1111 1110 01111808 which can pro-
duce strearns in the 1111101, there is but 0110, 117111011 01111 80118111117 affect
the water’s specific weight, viz: 17111111110118 01 teniperature. The sp. gra-
11111γ 01 sea-water on the contrary, besides being much more effected 1117
17111111110118 of teniperature, is still further affected by the descent of fresh
water upon its surface. Even if the whole basin of the ocean were
filled with fresh water and that water exposed to the most extreme 1110-
teorological intlucnces, which the different tracts of the earth present⁷ thence
the superficial 8110111118 produced would not be nearly equa] either in
power or extent to those we now obser-ve in the water 01 1110 ocean ¹).

We procced now to examine separately each 01 1110 01111808, which
tend to produce change in the specific gravity 01 sea-water, with 11 view
to ascertaining their influcnce on the water's motion⁷ and for simplicity's
sake we suppos-e 071ng one of thes-e calmes to (merare (11 (ι time. We have first:

¹) Although the itnportancc of specific gravity, as 111-10011113 the streams in fresh
and salt water, has already been carcfully pointed out by MAURY, I have novertheless
thought it best licre 10 1011011 upon that subject, because it (1008 not appear to me
that hc has adduc-cd the cause 011110 phoenomcna in question, which I look upon 118
the chief.
