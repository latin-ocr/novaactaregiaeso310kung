2 G. STEPHENS,

Both these works are described, with short extracts, by Prof. J.
H. SCHRODER in his »Iucunabula Artis Typographicae in Svecia», 4¹⁰, Up-
saliae 1842, pp. 12, 18.

For the communication of »Dyafwlsens Frastilse» to the general
public, we have to thank the well-known enthusiastic energy of the Swe-
dish Riks-librarian G. E. KLEMMING‚ by whom it was issued in Photo-
lithographic facsimile in 1876, first privately⁷ and then as Part 60 of
the valuable publications of the Swedish Early Text Society (Svenska
Fornskrift Sallskapet).

I am not aware that this remarkable book has attracted any notice.
Yet it is of high interest⁷ not only in itself as a literary curiosity⁷ the
first appearance of the printed mothertnng in Sweden7 but also as a
philological monument.

For this first Ssaeaealisle appeal to the Swedislc soll< thro the newly
in-taken Printing-press could not but be an important event. It was
carried thro by the powerful and enlightened Archbishop of the land,
and the version was by a learned dignitary of his Cathedral. Its object
was the religious instruction of the people, a duty as needful then as
now7 and the lang-uage used to reach the eyes and hearts ofSwecles was
of course SWEDISH.

But what is Swedish'?

The foolish modern talk about the »one language» spoken in all
Scandinavia in the oldest 111116, from »Lapland's bordei· to 1116 Eider», is
mere wind; and the dictum that this impossible »one langii-age» was
modern Icelamhc, is a ridiculons joke. Sweden and Denmark had been
mighty lands, and had the art of writing —- their RUNES, more tlzan α
thousand years before Iceland was even discovered, and their many and
ancient dialects stand on fam¹ older ground than 1116 oldest Icelandic yet
lmonm to us. What tlte first mia-t twigs was that sprang up in Iceland at
its settlement we (Io not know,- only it must have been largely made up
of West-Norse folk-talks. It was certainly vastly older 111311 and different
from the language in the oldest written Icelandic (the Homilies, eto),
which is 300 years later than Iceland's colonization, but whose words
and forms are of course iquored in all the »Gra1nmars» 1), —like as this
Homily-dialect is vastly older than and different from the 150 years

Ι) The only man who as yet has used these costly materials for purposes of
comparative philology is -— the Swede don. ER. RYDQVIST. I called attention to this
subject in 1872, in my notice of Prof. ΤΗ. ἎῙΙΒΕΝᾈ edition of the Icelandic Homily-
book in Stoekholm. See »Dansk Kirke-tidende». Sept. 8, 1872, p. 567-576,
