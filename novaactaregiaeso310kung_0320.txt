According to Pouillet's researches on the amount of heat, radia-
ted from the sun ¹), compared with Meech's work »On tlte relative inten-
sity of the lteat and hym of tlte sun», there must daily fall throughout the
whole of the torrid zone on an average 753 2) kilo-units of heat on ‚
every square decimetre of surface. Let us suppose that this quantity of
heat⁷ deducting only one fourth for atmospheric absorption, i. e. 56.5 kilo-
units on the square decimetre, is taken up by the sea-water, and that
the quantity of heat contemporaneously communicated to the Arctic zone
is = 03 we have thus7 with respect to the quantity of heat absorbed,
placed the calculation in a footing far too favourable to the former re-
gion. The loss of heat through evaporation and radiation must be im-
mensely greater in the Torrid than in the Arctic zone. But let us snp-
pose them equal, or, in other words7 take no account of these losses of
heat in calculating the difference of level between the two zones which
the phoenomena of heat would produce. We may in this case be sure,
that we shall not find the difference of level, caused by heat7 too little,
even though we should neglect the influence, which the atmosphere may
have on the sea⁷s temperature⁷ as also that arising from the ‚conversion
of motion into heat3 as regards this latter we have moreover as yet no
reason to suppose, that any greater difference of temperature between
different regions of the ocean would be caused by it. The maximum
differ-once of level, which the effect of temperature could produce in a
day between the sea-surface in the Torrid and the Arctic zones⁷ we
should therefore find by calculating the dilatation of the water. which an
accession of 56.5 kile-units of heat on every square decimetre of the
surface would produce. If we for this purpose calculate the dilatation
of a column of water 564 decimetres high, when the temperature is rai-
sed srom 24⁰ Centg. to 25⁰, we make the calculation in a manner too
favoni-able to the greatness of the dilatation. But the dilatationis ne-
vertheless only 1971„ millimetres.

However imperfect the observations of evaporation may be, we
may nevcrtheless with certainty assume, that the change of level⁷ pro—
duced by it in a day within the Torrid zone, is considerably more than
