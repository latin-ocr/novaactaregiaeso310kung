has there to pass over bars, Which have, at the most, 10 10 13 fathoms
(18 23 metres) of water over them. Between the Dauish Islands and
the Skagerack the depth iuereases 011 1110 whole pretty uniformly to
about 30 fathoms (54 metres), though at places depths of 50 sathoms (89
met.) have been found. But in the Skagerack the depth increases very
rapidly, so that between Jutland and Norway the depth sometimes ex—
ceeds 300 fathoms (534 met.) and reaches 100 fathoms (178 metres) at
many places near the Swedish coast. This deep channel, as is known,
thence continues along the coast of Norway; its south terminus penetra-
tes some distance into the Kattegat with a depth of about 50 fathoms (89
metr), The oceanic under-current has then in this part 111·οΨ free approach
and the locality is accordingly characterized by vzmejs'orm saltum-s· in deep
water and variable at tlte szcwjfaee. At 340 fathoms (606 metres) Ι obtai-
ned samples of 3515 ⁰,s0 saltness; at 100 fathoms near the Swedish coast
the saltness is 350 ⁰,s'0, and at 10 fathoms (17.8 met.) Ihave never found
less than 3 ‘'s‘O. But at depths less thau that the differcnces of saltness
are far greater. The outfiowing upper-current, in consequence of east-
ward deviation, keeps near the Swedish land, and by* its bottom and
west side ι(1110018 the surrounding sea—water, thus producing a 1011011011-

the surface-current, but a great· part of it proceeds 111 1110 form of a
stream, that reaches up to the surface, along the Danish coast towards
the Swedish coast, to unite itself in the Skagerack with the outflowing
stream, which falls 11110 1110 North-Sea at the southern coast of Norway.
Thus, while the saltness on the Jutland-coast approaches that of the
North—Sea-water, that on the Swedish coast is only about 2¹J'2 ⁰³0
mertime3 it moreover cxhibits great changes at different seasons aud
under different circumstances, because the causes, Which determine the
strength of the surface-current and the efflux of the superficial water
from 1110 Skagerack, are subject to variation.

111 the Kattegat the saltness of the surfaee-current 18 far less than
in the Skagerack, because it has not yet received the above mentioned
reaction-stream. In the northern part of the Kattegat 1110 saltness is
about 2 ‘'fo, but in the southern parts the percentage sinks considerably
below that. The saltness of the under-current is here also less, because
it is here obliged to approach nearer to 1110 upper fresher water-strata.
