THE FmsT Boou merssn IN Swrznisn. 25·

OlspE. So iu Sec. 76 (Thorpe 1, 418), ObeN gif man. -— Again, in
the Legend of S. Veronica (Mullers Collectanea Anglo-Saxonica, 8‘0.
Havniae 1835, p. 16, 1. 21), »be liam Haelende ObeN be hys leorning-
cnyhtum». — And in the S. Engl. Gospels (for instance in S. Matthew
in Anglo-Saxon and Nortlnnnbrian Versions, synopticallv arranged. Cam-
bridge 1858, nim), we have in the older S. E. codex, S. Mat. 5, 36,
ODDE, but in the later ODERNE and OnnNE. Many more examples
could be added, but these are sufficient. The eurious ODERNE above
is in fact a double comparative. We can take the -ER form of OlmE =
ODDER, or the -N form, OlmEN, ODDON. Barla toyetlter will give us
ODERNE. These English instances show local dialeets following the N
type when making an emphatic¹ cunarum-atne. In Germany the word went
another way. At the close of the Ohg. period there creeps in an em·
phatic comparative, and it rapidlv spreads in the Mid. Hg till it becomes
»orthodoxn in the Mod. (lemn, — but it takes the R ending, and thus
becomes ODAR, ODIR, the mod. German ODER.

Another English word, OFT, has gone the same way. It was
often used as an emphatic comparative, and became OFTER, but also
took the N shape as OFTEN. This OFTEN has now become (ι mat·
positive, alike in meaning to the older OFT, and we now use it as an
Adj. and Ache, OFTEN, OFTENER, OFTENEST, —just as some of
our foresathers had said ODERNE.

Minute enqniries in other directions and other tungs ma)v bring
fresh proofs of this -AN among the Scando-Gothie tribes. But enough
has been collected to show that this development must rest 011 older
maye. And the best kev to this older usage is the Sanscrit-group, which
has 2 comparative forms, both which (especially the —R) have left their
marks in all our Aryan talks. The zz-wal Sanscrit degree-couple, scaree
in Europe, is -TARA, sup. -TARA<S). -TA’, ⁷-MA. The other and warvr-
but gleneral in Europe, is that in -IYANS, -YANS, or (N nasalized)
-IYAS, -YAS, sup. -ISTA, —STA. The N remaining sharp and the S
(weakened to R) falling away, we get- the comparative in —AN. But the
N may be nasalized and drop out, giving ns -IYAS, -ISTA. The best
account of all this in simple language is in Bopp's ¹) Vergleichende
Grammatik, 8V0. End ed, Berlin. At p. 32 and fol. of Vol. 2, Berlin

¹) In my opinion Bopp would have been only too glad to add these interesting
scando-Anglic cxamples of -AN, in confirmation ot⁴ his reasoning, — is he had been
aware of them.
