fed froin the evaporating basin itself, thus discharging a quantity of
water corresponding to the surplus carried thither by the surface-streain.
This undercurrent penetrates trough the basius mouth into tho ocean
and there siuks in consequence of its greater weight. Provided the di-
mensions of the mouth afford sufficient room for this double circulation,
the specific weight of the *vvater 111 1110 basin can probably not att-ain
such an amount, that a real surplus of hydrostatic pressure should take
place from that side, were it not helped by the excess of water carried
thither by mechanica] reaction. ς

Τ1110 appears to me likely to be 1110 true explanation of the
double stream in the strait of Gibraltar. The theory, which attempts to
account for 1110 under-current exclusively by the greater specilic gravity
of the Mediterranean⁷s water, is besides destitute of the necessary soun-
dation, as long as we know nothing about the relative height of 1110
levels. The chief difference between the currents of Gibraltar and the
Sound appears to 1110 10 110, that in the first case the sui-face-curreut
flows froin a locality with constant level 10 0110, where the level 10 al—
ways sinking, whereas in the second case it Hows froin a region, where
the level 10 always rising, to one, where it is constant.

In further confirmation of this view I may be allowed to adduce
an experiinent, which I made 10 convince lnyselt', that a double stream
of this kind may be produced independently of the specific weight of the
water-strata. In a box of 12 decimetres length and 1¹ 2 decimetres broad
and deep I set up for the purpose a vertical partition in the middle,
in the upper part of which was an opening, about ¹³2 decimetre broad
and 1 dec. deep. The box was filled with fresh water and a stream,
yielding only about 100 cub.cent. per minute, was conducted to one end
of the box behind a pack of hards there put in, which caused the stream
to be uniformly distributed3 at the other end of the box the water esca-
ped through a 11010 at the sursace. Τ11011 011 innnersing a glass rod,
wetted with a solution of ι(111111110, perpendicular to the. boumn of the
box, I could by the diffusiori of the colour observe the slight motion of
the water at any depth. When the rod was placed 1111110 opening 111
1110 partition, a constant under-stream was observed 10 flow from the di-
vision of the box, from which the water escaped, to that, into which it
was admitted. This stream was then analogfflis to that, which exists
between the Mediterranean and the ocean, with merely the differ-once,
that in this case the water flowed instead of evaporating from the sur-
1000, and that no salt was present.
