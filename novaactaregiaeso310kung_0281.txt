of the surface-stream, caused by the change of 10101, whereby the 0011-
1111011011 111 1110 vertical direction is diminished, and ¹accordingly the diffe-

The effect 111011, that the earth's warlning in the neighbourhood
of the equator and cooling in 111111 of 1110 poles would have upon the
position and motion of the strata 111 1110 0001111, is there were no other

would be changed by rising 111 1110 equator and sinking 111 1110, poles.
The deviations from the normal level, which would thus 111130, would
111 301110 1110031110 approximate 10 111030, which according to the laws of
equilibrium 111 cornnninicatiiig tubes, would be calculated to take place,
supposing the waters specific weight at different depths 10 110 accuratcly
known. Two supcrficial 0111101113 of 11111111 water would flow froin the
equator towards the poles⁷ and two 1033 rapid iuider-currents of cold
water in the opposite dircction. All these streanis would diffuse 1110111-
301103 uniforinely over the whole 11101111111 of the 0001111, with only 311011
modifications as would 111-130 fron} 1110 form of the continents 1111111110 10-

The great effect, that 1110 cording of the oeean's surface has upon

arising from variation of temperature 1), agrees with what I have 1111010
described. If l rightly understand 111111, he supposes the ocean-surface
at the poles to be 011 a 10101 111111 that at the equator. In this case a
