38 C. 18121111 ΑΜ) G. Srrxrnfflx's,

ot' the inscription 111111 been smoothed off, to make way for something
neW, and the picce had thus been made into 11 public monument or a
kind of mile-stone, as we see by the crown and date and inonograin.
This 11181, says 8111111, is that of Frenmux ULRIK INSENs'rleRNA, owner of
Gysinge and Hadehohn, and Lord-lieutemlnt (Landshofding) in Vesteras
1763. He was born in 1723 and died in 1768. SAVE has left no reading.

The whole. 11180111111011 has probably been inore or less to the
following effect:

(..... nasu suu pnntfufar ..... kann seur uk ..... > ϋ111111
11011111 SEN1¹>.
( ..... raised stoue this t‘qf'fet‘ ..... quam (wife) siv (his), eh* . . . .)

AFTER MOTHER SIN( 2²l11’s3).

The grave-stone was therefore raised 111* 11 husband to 1118 departed
wife, the Son (or Daughter) joining in this act of piet)v to 1118 (her)
rnothor.
