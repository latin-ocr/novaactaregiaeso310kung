SAVE never saw 11118 block, but was in possession ofa good draw-
ing, which he communieated to 1116 17 ι16318 ago. This Ι have had
facsiniilied for Vol. 3 of 111)Υ »Old-Northorn Runio Monuinents», and Ι 11616
give my text 11161610, as 11 11111 appear in that work. Ι introduce it
there as bearing 1116 now aeknowledged local-dialectic ending -UR in
the gen. sing. feminine. This sorni was 11181 pointed out by CARL Sikyss,
supported with fresh examples by lnyself, denied or explained away or
called »quite 1161111 by others3 but we now see7 by a crowd of instances
ο my Vol. 3 alone contains 6 additional suoh in rums —- that it was
not unusual and was spread (however exceptionally) 0161 a wide sweep
of folkships in Scandinavia. For it was not confined 10 Sweden. My
oldest specimen is Danish7 an)›ove1·gang»-stone (bearing Old-Northern as
well as scandinaviam 1111168) from about the 11181 half of the 9111 century.
The runic examples thus run down from the 9th to the 14th ¹vearhundred.
But this forn] still lives in 1116 folk-talk of 1116 iland of Gotland.
