If an ocean-stream move forward in a mass of water, either at
rest or having a slower motion in the same or any other direction, the
mass of the former will during its progress continually increase, while
that of the latter diminishes3 for tlte more 'rapiti stream will communicate
its motion to 1116 water-molemus of the latter. Hence arises the sharp de-
finition of the 311631113, apparent even in the free ocean, which has so
often been an object of wonder to travellers. The mixture of the waters
of the different streams, which is formed at the place of contact, 13 111
fact carried off in the more rapid stream, in which is it absorbed. In
111031 63363 1116 111016 rapid stream is 3 surface—current of lighter water.
The water of it, that mixes with the surrounding heavier water, does not
therefore continue 10 1311 33 311 inter-mediate stratum between the streams,
but it sinks into the lighter 31163111, though not beneath it, as being
lighter than the slower stream's water. The sinking mixture 13 replaced
by other water, flowing from the middle towards the sides of the stream,
and 111113 311363 within the constantly advancing stream an inner circula-
tion in the place of its section. By this inner circulation an 011 1116
whole perpetual, though ever less and less marked difference is main-
tained between 11113 31163111 and the 111016 slowly flowing heavier water,
the 'properties of which remain almost unchanged3 for, though it parts
with some of its water, it receives none. This circulatimi, which 13 3130
reinforced by the difference of pressure between the two streams, 13
3130 probably the 631136 of the tendency, which free ocean-currents (e.
g. the Gulfstreem) display, to split longitudinally into new 31163313.

In some placeS, as 6. g. along the Swedish coast of the Ska-
gerack, it happens, that of two 311631113, running beside eachother, that
with the heavier water is the more rapid. In these cases the circula-
tion just described takes another course, in that 1116 mixture of lighter
water, which the heavier current continually acquires, flows upward. It
then happens, that for a moderate wind the undulations will be more
feeble on those parts of the heavier stream, which are contigumffl 10 1116
lighter water3 for new 11133363 of water, hitherto unaffected by the wind,
are there constantly rising to the surfacc.

Surface-ourrents of lighter water have a 1611616116)Υ 10 diffuse them-
selves, partly in consequence of the new water that they acquire, as
3130 in consequence of the greater 1316131 pressure due to their higher
level; this will be the greater the lighter the water is in comparison
with that aroun'd. An ocean-current of warin but salt water, such as the
