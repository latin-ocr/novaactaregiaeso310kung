Even if hydrodynamical scicnce were sufficiently developed to
treat this complicated problem, it would in the outset be stopped by
want of a competent body of observations. Although therefore there is
but slender prospect of science being soon in a condition, fully to com-
preheud all the causes of the vast current-motions in the open ocean,
we may nevertheless seek to approximate to that interesting subject of
human research, in order if possible at least to discover, what circum-
stances must in the first place be investigated in order that the ques-
tion may receive its proper solution.

If we set out from the principle, that with exception of the
streams, caused by the winds,or by other streams, the ocean-currents
are originally produced by dist'erences of level, and if it be further ad-
mitted, that it is the unequal distribution of heat, evaporation and rain-
fall, which chiefly gives rise to these differences, it would seem desirable
in the first place to inquire, how much the level of the sea iu a certain
region may bc altered in a unit of time by each of these causes, sup-
posing no motion for the moment to take place.

As regards the first, viz: tlte elzanjses of level causes] by licat, there
is only one way of determining them, namely by calculating the abso-
lute quantity of heat, which the sea within 11 given region acquires or
loses in a given time, froin the increase or decrease os warmth, thus
obtained as a result, the change of level must be deduced. As regards
the possibility of such a cal‹2·ulation, we may in the present state of
scicnce assume, that no sensible amount of warmth can now be commu-
nicatcd to the ocean through the crust of the earth. But the amount of
heat, derived froin the sun, is not only dependent on the sun's position
and the loss of heat, caused by the atmosphere's absorption and by the
reflectitur of the heat-rays from the surface of the sea, but also on the
inore or less regular nature of these. If the surface is smooth, the sun's
licat penctrates dceper3 if agitated, a greater portion is retained in the
supcrlicial stratum, and 116111 is more employed in forming vapour than
in the other case. The mean force of the wind has therefore licre in-
fluence, so much the more, as it is also for other reasons favourable to
evaporation. The licat lost by evaporation and also by radiation, which
quantities are very considerable and the greater the warnier the water
previously was, must be deductcd from the sunheat received. In such
a calculation it would be a mistake to neglect the atmospheric heat.
The heat, which the sunbeams leave in the atmosphere, and that, which
