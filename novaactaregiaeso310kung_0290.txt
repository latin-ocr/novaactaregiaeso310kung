whence we see that tlte velocz'tgs of tlte stream ‹Iecremses more glou-ly than
its mass meream Hence the moleeules 111 1110 following= part of the
stream have a tendency to separate themselves from those in the pre-
ceeding, or in other words⁷ the quantity of water at the locality we 3ῑο
considering suffers a decrease. If the stream be a superficial 0110, 1110
1ονοΙ of the moving water should be thus lowered, and7 isan under-
current, the level of the water above should also be lowered. The hy-
drostatic pressure of the moving water-strata is then reduced7 and in
consequence thereos 311 afflux of water from 1110 surrounding strata should
take place iu directior] 10 1110 former. The afflux of water, required for
the replacement of molecules carried of by the 51103111, 15 then helped by
the 1301, that 1110 velocity of the thus increascd current does 1101 de-
crease in the proportior] of the increase of the mass.

stream, arising from reaction⁷ has 10 move. That area is often very
great and the reaction-stream consequently scarcely sensible as 3 sepa—
rate stream. The streams caused by 3 disturbance of equilibrium, ex-
tending down to the 110110111, ought 10 be the least calculated to give
rise 10 reaction-streams; in 1301, in these cases⁷ the original motion
