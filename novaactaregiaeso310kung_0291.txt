Although in the ocean rcaction-strealns may, 110 we have 00011,
111100 from many 01111000, I will hcre in the first place confine inyself to
those produced by the outflow 01 rivers, because fron] the special exum-
ples of such streams, which Ι have the 0111101101111)γ of adducing, the
render will 110 better able to form 1111 1(1011 of the nature of 1011011011-
streains. Before however passing to these exzunples, it will be neces-
sary to take 11 somewhut general view of the question of river-water's
effect upon the 0011.

11 11110 long been observed 111111 111 0111111110, which unite the ocean
with separated 000111110 111101110, 111 which the annual influx of river-water
exceeds the evaporation from the surface, there is beneath the superfi-
cial current, which carries off the superfluous river-water to the 0011, 1111
under-current 01 01111 water in the opposite direction. This phoenomenon
is in fact of 11 01111 more general nature. Every river or brook, which
falls into the 0011, gives rise to 1111 under-current directed towards its
embouchure. These under-currents are so distinct and the causes, that
produce 1110111, so active, 111111 111 calm weather their presence may be
easily observed at 1110 111011111 01 1110 111001 insignificant rivulet, 111111 falls
out over the surface of the 0011.

11 11110 been usual 10 explain the wider-current in such 011-«1110, 110
0. g. Oresund, by supposing that the sea-water outside in consequence
of 110 greater specific gravity displaced 1110 fresher and lighter water in
the separated ocean-basin and thus flowed into it in the form of 1111
under-current. The sanie 1011001110,εέἱ ought therefore 10 110 applied 10 1110
under-currents at the 1110111110 01 rivers. This explanation, however simple
it may appear, seems nevertheless 011 closer examination not to be 011110-
factory. If we supposed the outfiow from 11 river suddenly to stop,
110 00011 110 1110 river had deposited a certain quantity of fresh water 011
1110 sur-face of the sea, 1101 only would assuredly a superficial current of
outflowing fresh water arise, but also an under-current of salt-water 111
1110 opposite directior] in consequence of the water-stratas differences of
pressure, and these would continue till the fresh water was carried off,
according to what 11110 above been explained more fully in the case of
streams caused by heat and rainfall. But if the river continued 10 flow
with the 0111110 velocity, which caused the formation of the fresh-water-
stratum before the mouth, it 0001110 clear, 111111 water could not run away
in consequence of the excess of hydrostatic pressure more rapidly, than
