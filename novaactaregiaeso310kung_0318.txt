Even if hydrodynamical scionce were sufficiently developed to
treat this complicated problem, it would in the outset be stopped by
want of a competent body of observations. Although therefore there is
but slender prospect of science being soon in a condition, fully to com-
prehend all the causes of the vast current—motions in the open ocean,
we may nevertheless seek to approximate to that interesting subject Of
human rescarch, in order if possible at least to discover, what circum-
stances must in the first place be investigated in order that the ques-
tion may receive its proper solution.

If we set out from the principle, that with exception of the
streams, caused by the winds or by other streams, the ocean—currents
are originally produced by difforences of level, and if it be further ad-
mitted, that. it is the unequal distribution of heat, evaporation and rain-
fall, which chiefly gives rise to these differences, it would seem desirable
in the first place to inquire, how much the level of the sea in a certain
region may be altered in a unit of time by each of these causeS, sup-
posing no motion for the moment to take place.

As regards the first, viz: the chausses of level cazm‘rl hy leeat, there
is only one way of determining them, namely by calculating the abso-
lute quantity ot' heat, which the sca within a given region acquires or
loses in a given time3 from the increase or decrease of warmth, thus
obtained as a result, the change of level must be deduced. As regards
the possibility of such a calculation, we may in the present state of
scicnce assume, that no sensible amount of war-nith can now bc commu-
nicated to the ocean through the (trust of the earth. But the amount of
lieat, derived from the sun, is not only dependent on the sun's position
and the loss of heat, caused by the atmosphere's absorption and by the
reflection os the lieat—rays from the sur-face of the sea, but also on the
more or less regular nature of these. If the surface is smooth, the sun's
hcat pcnetrates deeper3 if agitated, a greater portion is retained in the
supcrficial stratum, and heat is more employed in forming vapour than
in the other case. The mean force of the wind has therefore here in-
fluenoe, so much the more, as it is also for other reasons favourable to
evaporation. The heat lost by evaporation and also by radiation, which
quantities are very considerable and the greater the warnier the water
previously was, must be deducted from the sunheat received. In such
a calculation it would be a mistake to neglect the atmospheric heat.
The heat, which the sunbeams leave in the atmosphere, and that, which
