segment. Those gasti-ic vessels seem not to be connected with the 17811-
tral bloodvessel, but end in or 011 1118 walls of the intestine.

Between the large gastric vessels a very minute rectilinea] 1181 of
vessels is seen entirely covering the intestine and oesophagus. The
blood itself is yellowish 1811, pulsating in all dors-al vessels.

Of perigastric vessels are found one pair in each segnient7 close
to its posterior integuxnent, or in the middle of its 11181 1111111181. Τ11817
are connected with 1118 ventral 1788881, and emit many secondary bran-
81188, which partly 801111111111181118 1171111 each 011181, partly with the peri-
gastric system of the next segment in 1’1·0111., partly also end in the
perigastric cavity. Two of those 1811111117 branches 1118 considerably
larger than 1118 0111818, and take their origin near the junction of the
ventral vessel 111111 1118 11111111 perigastric vessel, and project from there
obliquely toward the front part of the body, and communicate with the
perigastric vessels of the next segment. Ι have no doubt that those
perigastric vessels 111-8 hoinologous to 1118 two Iateral branches in the
7⁰¹ seglnent7 and with the 11811118 111 1118 8¹¹¹ and 0¹¹¹ seglnents.

In the 6 anterior segments the perigastric vessels forn] a perfect
ring⁷ connecting the two 11111111, and the two lateral vessels with each
other. All perigastrie vessels 811111 minute secondary 111111181188, which
spread in the integ-tinient os the body7 here c‹s›nstituting the 1181111111
vascular systeme. Fig. 8 Pl. I.

Thus the vaseular systelne of (jeneroclrilus differs considerably
from that of any previfflisly known Lz'me'wle, but 1·ese1nbles that of Lum-
briculidw in having gastric vessels which do not communicate with the
ventral 11111111 1788881. 11 also reselnbles 'l‘aslnjfieidae in having large puls—
ating hearts.

The seg-mental organs arc present in all setigerous segments ex-
cept in the 131¹· S* 1⁴3⁰& 111 1118 former they are replaced by 1118 0171110818,
and in the latter by 1118 efferent duc-ts 111111 receptacle, which both open
111 1118 same segnient and into the porus. The whole organ reselnbles
more that of 11 Lz'vmodrilccs or Tubzfeae, than those described as belong-
ing 10 any genus of Lmnbriwclidan The interior opening is 1101 sur-
rounded by any large brown glands, 118 18 1118 case in Rlzfflzclwlmis,Phrea-
totltrim, etc.⁷ and the entire duct is dcvoid of all large translucent cells,
like those found in legflzs·he[112c'3¹) or in certain species of Limnodrilm.

The interior opening is situated close to 1118 exterior one, and
the main body of the organ extends far up towards the dorsal part of

the body. Pl. II Fig. 13.
