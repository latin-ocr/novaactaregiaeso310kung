ΟΝ THE GENERAL Clausus or THE OcEAN-CURRENTS. 35

On another occasion I poured into the box a solution of common
salt to about half its depth and then filled up carefully with fresh
water. I then let it sta-nd for some hours to allow strata of different
saltness, but in perfect equilibrium, to form themselves, and then re-
peated the above experiment with the weak stream. At the aperture of
the partition Ι thus obtained four opposite streams, viz: at the top one
outflowing, under which was one flowing inward3 under this was on
outflowing and then again an inflowing stream. The difference between
this and the preceeding experiment is easily accounted for by what I
have above said about the shallowness of surface-currents, when the
difference of specific gravity is great; in this case both the surface-cur-
rent and its reaction-stream were so shallow, that thc remaining depth
of the critice was sufficient for the lat-ter to produce its own pair of
reaction-currents. This phocnomenon will no doubt be met with in
nature.

Before quitting 1116 question of the reaction-streams, Ι beg to re-
capitulate partly the result of this special research, and to examine from
my point of view some circumstances, which may be of importance in
forming a clear notion of the ocean-currents properties and movements.

If a free ocean-current be supposed to move under such circum-
stanceS, that the loss of vis viva, which it suffers from the resistance of
friction at every point of its course be always compensated from some
constantly active source, the mass of water, which the stream carries by
111 a unit of ¹time, would continually increase3 for the streanis velocity
then decreases more slowly than its mass increases (pag. 18). Although
Ι might not try to calculate the influence on the velocity of an ocea-
1110 stream, arising from the conversion of a part of its vis viva into
heat, nevertheless it seems probable, that the state of the case not
will be entirely changed by this little loss of vis viva. At all events
the mass of the moving water will be considerably enlarged by the me-
canical reaction of the stream on thc neighbouring water-strata, and in
general Ι think we may say, that effac-§dom of [ifflzz‘er water on tlte Ocecm
produce macla more powers'ul am] virore Iastiny current-5, than what from

their oriyinal mass one would have e„z¹J)ectesl. — This circumstance has
without doubt been too much overlooked, thus e. g by MAURY, when

from the section and velocity of the Gulf-stream at the Florida pas-
sage, compared with those at Cape Hatteras he endeavours to calculate
the inclination of its under surface ¹).
