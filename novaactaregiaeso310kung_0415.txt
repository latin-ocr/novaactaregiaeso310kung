Some RissNre s'romzs. 527

Of the raiser's name only . . . . IN <with the nom. mark -R) is
here left.

IN, should it be so, is antique, the N not yet slurred.

THUNAIM (TH for T as so frequently) is (THUNHAIM) 'l'l'N-
HEM or TFNA. There are yet several plaees so called in Sweden and
Norway, and there have been more. We eannot know whether there was
one 111 Helsingland, or whether ....IN was settled in xx'estergotland 01·
Nol-way or elsewhere.

TINE, pillar-stone7 grave-mark, occurs ver)v t'1·e‹11uently side by side
with stone. And as we so often have ISTAN, ISTIN, ete. for STAN,
STIN, ete.7 so we as often have ITAN, l'l'lN, ote. for TAN, TIN, ete.
In my Old-Northern Runie nionulnents 1 have several examples of this
TAN, TIN, ITAN, ITIN⁷ ete.. and in niy forthcoming 3rd volume Ι have
collected S) others.

other such verbs7 3 singular past‚ with the old (“)- 01· 1⁷-ending.

STHRIAS (Ξ STRIAS> is a lnansnalne l have never seen before.
It seems to be one of the rare epithets ending in AS (ANS). Perhaps,
with the so common elision of 1), 11 is Ξ s'FRIb-As, Battlfl-stlziqs‘.

The scando-Gothic mansname RI‘NAR (RFNHARI) has not before
been found 111 11111100, 11111 we have the side-sorni RUNI with its fem.
RL'NA. (Whether we take this RFN in RFNAR to be RFN a 1-11110, 01·
,ΒΠΝΙ (RONE) a 1111111110, wild-boar‚ makes 110 differenee to the argu-
ment.) The -LFRUNAR apparently points 10 ALFRFNAR a name not
before 11101 with. Ι prefer AL-FRUNAR 21ll-fr0nvzm·‚ the ΕΜΓ-ῥυινηὶημ.

AFLA, ta ABLE, yet, oeeurs more than 01100 before on our runie
stones. Here 11 is found, for the first 111110,111 reference 10 1110 pillaritself.

W'e have Sl'NAN-LAN'R ae. pl. 11., 011 the. Maeshowe bloek, Ork-

Thus, if the above be admitted, this ancient epitaph is now nearly⁷
restored to us7 — thanks to Silviis drawing. But of eourse Ι only offer
my restoration — till a better eomes.

Should the LINI in the second line be the LINI UN'S SON os
the Malstad 111011011111, then the above (a)LFR[†NAl-z. was a brother of
BRISI LINA-SON, the father of FIHIULFI. 'Phe 'l'una stone will then
be about (30 years older than that at Malstad. Most likely this is so.
Both are Christian memorials.
