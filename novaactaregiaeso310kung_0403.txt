There is 11 third example on the Saistad block7 Upland (Dybeek,

Sg'xvn has unhappily left no version7 111 least us far 118 l know.
Most of the words 1116 plain enough. Some ure so much the. harder.
The order of the lines we shall never know. Probably Sikvn's 18118 good
as any other. W'e 61111 111 01166 read K instead of H7 if 1νο1’011(’)11’Β1’11(1Ε.

With regal-d to this 11181 question, it seems to 1116111111 Silviis
1111118111611111011 18 111016 exact 1111111 1311110118. 1 know nothing of the 1611-
sons which led SAVE 10 fix upon H 118 1116 1111116 of the mark. Nor 61111
Ι anticipute the arguments which will be brought forwurd by Bruen for
his K. But in my eyes 1111 111686 Hclsing runes 111-6 simply »short-hand»,
11 salient part of the stave being taken 10 repressent the whole. All the
other letters show this. Why should 1116 Κ bc 1111 exception? The Ι 111
γ 18 110 distinctive mark, and 18 besides used 111 these Helsing-runes
for itself, 1116 vowel Ι (I). 11 18 1116 ³ which gives Ρ 118 character. Should
K therefore ever be found among these »short-hancb· signs, it will pro-
bably be 118 l or something like it. But to say 111111 ψ und ψ und Α,
(3 variations5 the 0116 11 little siinpler than 1116 other⁷ of the 8111116 type, Φ)
can represent Ρ, —is to 1116 100 hard. If the K-sign had been &there
might have been some bare possibility7 by cutting off 1116 1001111111 length-
ening it instead upward (from *t 10 Φ and then 10 ψ) There would
at all events have been the V somewhere. But ’1 is 1101 1116 111110 for K.
it stands for M.

Oonsequently Ψ 8661118 10 1116 quite clearly short for ¹, which is
itself short for (ll, which 18 Η. l therefore look upon Φ 118 H, not K.

In late middle-aye Seandinavian stave-rows. made to imitate the
Latin alphabet, «t (as short for <1>> 18 Η; but Ψ, »ι (118 111111111111011 os xlm
S) is used for C.

And in fact H occurs very frequently (in both runic und Roman
letters) with 11 strong gszcttzcral power, neither so bare 118 G nor so shurp
as K. It is this local ‹lt'aleetz'c sound of H, which 1 believe to be here
given on these Helsing stones. Runic H 11118 frequently been 111111811161-
ated 118 GH or GH. The wellknown Hunic MS. of the Skime-law 11118
crowds of this >k for GH, in addition to the connnon runcs for G and Κ,
