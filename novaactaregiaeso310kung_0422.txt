34 (J. SAVE AND G. STEPHENS,

4. CARL sssvss: Note-book p. 23. No drawing. Gives the runes alone⁷
as copied by him 10 Sept. 1851. Only the main pieee, and that with
errors.

5. A drawing in my collections by ALBERT BERG and Vanam UPP-
s'rRoM in 1867. Only the main pieee. Agrees with Bona, but the T
after RISTU was then gone.

For greater elearness‚ I will parallel these readings:
BURE. RFALTR OK UTR LITU RISTU S(T)IN lFTR
BAUT. L'RANR OK UTR LITU RISTU S .........

LILJ. VRATVI OK UTR LITU RISTU S ........

We see that the earesul drawing made by BERG and UPrs'rRoM
exaetly agrees with the very oldest by BURE, as far as it goes, and that
we may consequently depend on Eum: for 1113 copy of the fragment
which 13 now lost.

I have therefore had photoxylographt their valuable drawing of
1867, but have added to it the now missing bit, as given by BURE. In
this way we get the following text7 whieh 13 evidently correct:

RUALTR Ol( UTI-3 LITU RIS'J'U STJN IFTR [mu. . .) ΟΧ LITSIA‚
(fahur sin. Κιῲ biarki Ο>Κ [ULBI ONTA (110113).

RUALT EKE UTR LET RIST (inscribe) this-STONE AFTER IRM(. . .)
ΟΝ (of, (tt) LITSIA (father siu (thr—ir). God bars] (sace. Mass) EKE J-IELP OND
(soal) (1113)]

We feel that we are here on firm ground. RUALT (Ξ HRUINJVALD)
13 also found in runies as HRUALTR, ROIJUALDR, with a gen. RUHALTS
and an ae. ROUILT.

UTR also appears in runies as OTAR, UTAR.

RISTU 13 another proof of the N having fallen away in the infi-

nitive, which has eolored (to O, U) the foi-egoing vowel A (RISTAN‚
RISTU, not yet RISTA).

IRM. .. may have been IRMUNT, or some such name.
