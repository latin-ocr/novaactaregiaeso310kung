and economical tracts, and Custonis' documents and folk-books and state-
papers and so on. We find interesting things of this sort even in
writings publisht by svlwlarly authors, such as Olaus Petri, Laurentius
Upsalensis, Petrus Johannis Gothus, Petrus Ionae, N. Balck, Petrus Erici,
Andreas Laurentii, A. J. Tiderus and a host of others. All this is prae-
tz'eal work⁷ very different from the endless theories and hair-splittings
now so fashionable. But it is hard work, and needs many workers. The
fact is, men fron] all parts of SWeden served the State or the Church,
or were privately active, using the press, and hence in spite of their
»educatimm give us in some degree their local mother-speech, which we
can sometimes identify by the still living dialects.

But in this way our older Swedish ))G1·aminar)›‚ as well as »Dic-
tionary», will be largely modified and enricht, and we shall see that the
whole »iron law» system is unnatural and untrue. All speech is always
in a. flux. Every book—tung is only a barbarizathnn of what has gone
before, and abounds in exception-al archaisms and exceptional neologisms,
and gradually slides over into new forms, while old words fall away
and new ones come in. The oldest and most »orthodom Sanscrit or
Moeso-Gothic or Greek or Latin or Icelandic are only corruptions of
previous folk-talks, surrounded by dialects ever ready to mix with them
or take their place. In England with its rich succession of Runic and
Roman monuments and documents from the 5ΠΙ century downwards, We
can follow all this plainly, and study and group the English Northern,
Midland and Southern dialects, which differ so largely froin each other
at the sanie nominal date, some being young in development while old
in years, others conservative and antique in form while young] in age,
but all endlessly running into each other. In Scandinavia all parchment
remains of real antiquity have perisht. We have nothing left but What
is vomparatively modern, NOT Old-Scandinavian or even Early-Scandina-
vian, but Jsz'ddle-Scamlioelavian from the very earliest vellums (in Iceland)
of about the year 1200 to the 15ΗΔ century. Hence to parallel the oldest
Old-Engqlisli we must fly to the only Old—Scamlinavian known 10 118, the
ristings with Old-Northern runes in the Scandian lands3 as parallel to
Early-Engylisli, something 111010 primitive than the skinbooks, we must
read what is cut in Early-Scamlz'navian in the later or Scandian 1111108.
Then we may take up Alsiddle-Enylislz, comparing it With the Middle-
&fandinavian of the parchments left in scandinavia. Now we know
that the Old-Affirtlzern runic inscriptions in Scandinavia as wellas the
oldest Seamlc'an are few and short, and have been redd differem& by
