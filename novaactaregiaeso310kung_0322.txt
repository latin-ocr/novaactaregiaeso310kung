diffcrence will, as we find⁷ be largely increased. What 111011 ought to
be the final result of these changes of level? Will it be a single current
towards the equator⁷ driven by the differ-once of lovel arising from eva-
poration and rainfall, diminished by that. arising from lieat'? Or will it
be two opposite streams, the one driven by the former diffcrcnce undi-
minished⁷ and the other by the latter difference‘? The answcr to this
question is evident from what has prececded. The difference of level7
produced by 1110 combined effects of evaporation and raiufall, disturbed
the equilibrium of the ocean down to the bottom, that arising from heat
disturbed it only to a certain limited depth. The result will accordingly
be two streams7 one of large 30011011, towards 1110 equator, the other 3-
shallow surface-current of warin water7 from the equator3 and the former
stream7 as being caused by a more rapid change of level, will carry to-
wards the equator far more water in a unit of time7 than the latter will
carry from it. In addition to these two motions there will be a third⁷
viz a surfaCe-st.r0·am‚ descending towards lower latitudes, caused by the
disturbance of the superficial strata's equilibrium7 which was the second
consequence of rainsall.

The origin of these vast strcams then is to be lookcd for in di-
sturbances of the ocean's level so 3111311, that thcir daily amount can
only be expressed in millimetres and fractions of millimetres. Β111,11111011
these little changes of level begin to work upon the quiescent mass, the
difference of level increascs in a more rapid ratio than the stream it
produces.⁷ 31101, when both at last have reached 'a constant 31310, 1110 dif-
ference of level may easily be considerable.

From the fact, that the change of level produced by cvaporation
and rainfall is greater than that resulting from 11031, we are not· forced
to conclude, that the sea—level around the polarcircle is higher than

nation produce⁷ has a far greater depth 1113111110 ascending warni stream,
and the difference of level⁷ which occasions tho former stream⁷ may
therefore much sooner arrive at its maximum than that, which has to
drive the latter. As regards this question I may refer the reader to
what Ι have above 111010 fully said, regarding 1110 motion of sui-face-
currents in comparison with under-streams.

In order to get a clearer view of the nature of the streams be-
fore 113, let us first endeavour to understand how they might originate,
if the ocean were previously at rest. Here we must 100011001, 11131,
