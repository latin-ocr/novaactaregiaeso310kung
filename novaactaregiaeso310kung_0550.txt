6 G. 8151111555,

As I 1111νο said again and again, 50 far from one »Grammarw or
»WVOrdbookn in one great land-group for 1000 winters, every indepen-
dent document or monument from the old uncentralized times 11115 111 a
certain sense and to 11 certain degree 111 every country its own Grammar
and its own Wordbook, with endless transitional forms and meanings and
pronominal twists or survivals in the changing local dialects3 —- for no
caprice is so capricious 115 1110 caprice of language, as long as it lives,
is not bound down by central violence, or has 1101 become a venerable
mummy ¹).

The first printed Swedish book therefore, seen in this light, cannot
but 110 111051 111511·11011νο. Written by 11 learned ecclesiastic under Archi-

episcopal protection, — does it give us »fixt forms», uniform spellings,
»orthodoxr grammar, regular syntax, and all such things? - Nothing of

the sort. Viewed with peclantical eyes, it is »confusion worse confounded».
But taken practicully it 15 exaetly what we should expect, an edifying
treatise well given in 1110 Βο011-81νοε11511 of the day, with archaisms and

¹) England‚ America and France have never bowed their necks; and even in
(iel-many, the home of thc arrogance and »11011 laws» and »national unity oflanguage»,
which have hampcred and damagcd 50 greatly what is called »Modern Philology» —
a great roaotion has set in, and this in many directions. It took a long time to get
rid of the slavery under »llloeso-Gothic», as if the bits in the XVulfila-scriptorium (and
even t-hey show various grammatical variations‚ some of them ))illegyal›)) exhausted all
the scattered Gothic dialects. People at last now also rebel against being shut up in
the copper box called »Semel-it». The claim of the local solk-talk is now being
dist-inctly acknowledgcd. I will give one of the latest examples:

»Der schreiber der Lcidener handschrift von W⁷illirams paraphrase des Hohen
liedes ist 50 zu sagen cin Berliner. Er verwechselt in seiner sprache mir und mih und
fiihlt sich darin so sicher dass 01· (110 falschen for-men gegen die richtigcn seiner vorlage

einsetzt ......... Dcr schreiber der Leidener hs. gehorte demnaeh einer gegend

men fielen». m Selia-er, Schriftspraehe des elstera Jalesrhundertffi· Zeitschr. f. (leutsehes

Ten 01· twenty years ago, all this common sense and matter-of-fact would have
been impossible. Hence all such linguistic illegalitics were »corrected» and »normal-
izedn, and therefore are most German editions of olden writers -— wastepaper. And
even later and the latest foreign and Scandinavian editions of Ieelandie Poems and
Sages are commonly more or less wastepaper, as far as philology is concerned. They
are usually careless and incorrect; exceptional words and forms are often destroyed,
or put into an illegible small-type note; and frequently the whole text is »normal-
izedn, or else it is serewed back to »the correct Saga-style», so that every trace of
each century on the language altogether disappears, and we thus get the boasted
»unchanging Icelandic». But the world is governed by humbug.
