SOME RUNIC s'roNEs. 35

ΟΝ is the antique proposition ΟΝ (AN)⁷ with the N still left, thus
not yet O (A).

The place-name Ll'rsm (or whatever it was in the nominative)
others must clear up. In ,Jssimtland there is a parish called LIT. There
may have been a spot in Gestrikland called LIT-SIA, LIT-SELQ Lake Lz't.

We have the formula TU JL-‘Jlrm AND HELP on many other
stones, and the dative ONTA is common.

All this is on the .s‘*lc])p‹).<¹l'†icm that we have substantially the true
text, which I believe, and that my arrangement of it is on the whole
correct. The mistam& made by some of the copyists have arisen from
the peculiar interlacing of the runos7 some of which may easily be mis-
taken the one for the other. These staves are the most elegant ever
yet discovered on any ancient runis· mmmment, and show the stone-
mltter to have been a superior artist.

THORSAKER, GESTRIKLAND.
