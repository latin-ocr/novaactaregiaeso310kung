Ox THE GENERAL CAUSES OF THE OCEAN—CURRENTS. 33

cific weight are balanced by differences of level, and the under—current
into the Baltic driven only by the reaction of the outflowing surface-
current, the occurrence of a great fall of the barometer over the North-
Sea, or a great rise over the Baltic, might cause the under—current in
the Sound to be reversed in consequence of the hydrostatic pressure in
the Baltic being increased down to the bettoni. A number of complica-
ted cases are here possible, for example lastly among others, that by a
rising of 1116 Kattega‘t in consequence of the effect of the wind in the
North-Sea, the Kattegat just arrived at the level of the Baltic and the
bettoni-water streamed into the Baltic only in consequence of its greater
specific gravit-y ¹).

b) {eaetion-Streams arz'sings from evaporation.

When the water in an ocean—basin evaporates more rapidly than
the fresh water from the surrounding rivers can compensate, its level
must be lowered relatively to that of the ocean3 the equilibrium between
these water-districts is thus disturbed down to the bottom and the
ocean's water flows in. The little additions of hydrostatic pressure,
which the water in the first named locality experiences in consequence
of the salt remaining there, gradually coalesce, and it is clear that, if
the water were not changed, the higher water-column between the
bottom and the surface at· the basin's mouth might be at last balanced
by the lower one above the level of that depth at the opposite extre-
mity of the basin. The difference of pressure in the lower strata would
thus be neutralized, but because the inclination of the surface still re-
mains, a stream of less depth would 0011613011)γ flow 10 1116 evaporating
locality. But as soon as this state of things took place, or then at
least, the in-flowing surface-stream must react on the subjacent stratum
in the mouth, according to 1116 laws above expounded. The surface-
current therefore carries into the basin more water than what otherwise
should be the consequence of the difference of pressure between 1116 11νο
water-regions, and by the abasement of level, which is caused 31 1116 111011111
by the streams reaction, the equilibrium there again is disturbed down
