in order to form the equations required in CAUCHY'S method of elimina-
tion (See, for instance, M. Βοετοκ, Εἰόφηεηΐδ [Ie la lec'ore'e des Βότω-νηί-
nante, pag. 118), then to divide, one by another, these last-written
equations, which gives

and finally to clear of fractions and to transpose all the ternis to the left
member. We thus obtain an equation, the left member of which evi-
dently is the very function f‚.(J·), such as it is written in (6) cleared of
superfluous ternis.

VI. As to the method now given we make the. following re-
marks, viz.

lStly Every time the Rule in IV is applied, it gives two new func-
tions, both of lower degree than the next foregoing oneS, and

2⁰⁶ly It cloes not require any division, because that in V can be
replaced by multiplicatiori and subtraction.
