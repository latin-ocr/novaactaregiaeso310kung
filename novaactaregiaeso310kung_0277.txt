ΟΝ THE GENERAL (lausus or Tui: OcEAN-Crnmzx'rs. 5

the difference ot' pressure only extends to a certain depth7 than when 11
extends to the bot-tom: and 111 general a greater time is required, when
the difference of pressure extends to a less (1611111, than when to a greater.

From these theorems⁷ the truth of which I need not. stop to de-
monstrate, I shall now endeavour to draw some general csmclusions7 re-
specting the effect7 which differences of specific gravity between the
waters in different parts of the ocean can have 011 1116 origin of oceani(-
streams.

If we detine the normal sea-level as 11131, which would result from
the force of gravity and the earths rotation with the mean harometric
pressure⁷ certain deviations from that level must take place in conse-
quence of different specific gravity 111 diffiffrent parts of the ocean, and
these deviatione ought 10 approximate 10, 11111 1101 fully reach those,
which would be determined by thc inverse ratio of the 811. gravities of
the water-strata ¹).

Let us first suppose the case 01· the water in a certain part of the
ocean being lighter 111311 the rest down to a distance, 11, below the sur-
face, but that the surface itself is everywhere normal. Two different
kinds of motion would immediately 116 produced. The lighter water
would be lifted by the surrounding heavier7 till the difference of pres-
sure at the new level of its lower side7 η’, vanished, but7 as its pressure
at all levels above η’ have now become greater 111311 11131 of the heavier
water⁷ it would instantly begin to displace and overflow the latter. This
movement of the lighter water would however require considerably more
time 111311 1116 movement of the heavicr water7 whereby the lighter was
lifted and continues to 116 1111611, as its level siuks by lateral diffusion.
For the sum of the differences os 1116881116, which caused the elevation
of the lighter water, were 111 1116 first place greater, than the sum of the
differences, that caused its diffusiori towards the sides. Secondly the
differences of pressure, which caused the first motion7 must extend all
the. way to the bottom⁷ whereas 111086, which cause the latter7 extend 110
deeper than the lighter stratum itself, and even within the extentos
that have their chief effect confined to the superficial strata. With re-
gard 10 1116 velocity of these 1110110118, that of the heavier water will be
relatively little sensible‚ because it takes place in a section of larger
area, but the motion of the lighter water will be seen to form a more
rapid and more clearly defined stream.

¹) Some important exceptions os this last statement will be hereafter noticcd.
