»The risu nt UIHA is a puzzu· to mm lusum as a dat. s. 11. 1 can-
not. aeeept; it must then be (livided bISU. But what are we to do with
Rl UIHA or RIUIHA (hitherto redd incorrectly UISlnzh ¹). XVhere SRVE
failed7 I may well trip also. I therefore propose 1ny ideas with great

diffidenee.

bISU Ι take to be THIS, in the dat. or ae. sing. f. But l'ISU
is else (blssSSU, bESSO, lJUISA) dat. s. neat. Hitherto we have no ex-
ample of bISU as dat. or ae. sing. feni. to agree with Rl (Rlb), whieh
is everywhere femini11e2). In our omes-t scando-English inontnnentS, how-
ever, we have very] many surprising local variations and confusions in
the ease-forins of this pronoun as of others, and fresh >›varia11ts» are
found yearly. They will one day be earefully collected by a student of
facte. not theories. RYDQVIST (Sy. Spr. Lag-ar, H, 496> has only glaneed
at a very few of them. Ι therefore think this »illegaln form to be no
real difficulty.

RI I look upon as the word RH) (ΗΠ)Ἴ leel. HRID, Old-Engl. HRID⁷
time, period, all seur). Of old7 phrases of time, when this terni was
employed, were in the dat. or ne. with or without a preposition. PISU
RI would therefore be at Παῖς time. them. It is a date. But it helps us
not. For we eannot say when the lnystieal HIULFIR (or GYLFIR) lived.

gender, were once masa, then fem. or muter, ete. Erery day we are finding words in
to us formerly unknown genders. Of this Rl may be a new instance. Theresore,
also from this standpoint, Rl as neuter, PISU RI may be perfeetly regular and correct.
