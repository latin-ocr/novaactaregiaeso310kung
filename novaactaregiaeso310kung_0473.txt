The veriti-al mus-sel is forked in the 4²¹¹ seligemus segment.

The «laneat lateral vessels two pair in every segment: the anterior7

pair, ms which the anterior is gasti-ic :ind the posterior perigastricn

The qffermt ‘lm-ts are not grown together, ancl enter an atrium,
which is 011 all sides sum-‹iunded by prostare glaucis, and opening in the
9⁰· setigerous segmen‘s. A larg(¹ exterior penis.

The rems* are three, but not in pair3 one is situated in eaeh of
2——

the segrnents 7, 9, 11 and 12.

¹) As it therefore is likely, that the ποι-1115 studiml by ῗΑΤΖΕι, Vfflnovsxr and
others, and by them referred to the genus [unuln-iculm, have really belonged to quite
different, and as anovsm suggests even new genera, have I here retained all char-
acteristics given by ·('12APA'1ti‘:1›1·1. not withstansling the opinions of lator investigarem.
